              <p>Reference counting techniques? Nothing new, you might think.
              Every good C++ text that takes you to an intermediate or
              advanced level will introduce the concept. It has been explored
              with such thoroughness in the past that you might be forgiven
              for thinking that everything that can be said has been said.
              Well, let's start from first principles and see if we can
              unearth something new....</p>

              <h2>And then there were none...</h2>

              <p>The principle behind reference counting is to keep a running
              usage count of an object so that when it falls to zero we know
              the object is unused. This is normally used to simplify the
              memory management for dynamically allocated objects: keep a
              count of the number of references held to that object and, on
              zero, delete the object.</p>

              <p>How to keep a track of the number of users of an object?
              Well, normal pointers are quite dumb, and so an extra level of
              indirection is required to manage the count. This is
              essentially the PROXY pattern described in <i>Design
              Patterns</i> [Gamma, Helm, Johnson &amp; Vlissides,
              Addison-Wesley, ISBN 0-201-63361-2]. The intent is given as</p>

              <blockquote>
                <p><i>Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object
                to control access to it.</i></p>
              </blockquote>

              <p>Coplien [<i>Advanced C++ Programming Styles and Idioms</i>,
              Addison-Wesley, ISBN 0-201-56365-7] defines a set of idioms
              related to this essential separation of a handle and a body
              part. The <i>Taligent Guide to Designing Programs</i>
              [Addison-Wesley, ISBN 0-201-40888-0] identifies a number of
              specific categories for proxies (aka surrogates). Broadly
              speaking they fall into two general categories:</p>

              <ul>
                <li><i>Hidden</i>: The handle is the object of interest,
                hiding the body itself. The functionality of the handle is
                obtained by delegation to the body, and the user of the
                handle is unaware of the body. Reference counted strings
                offer a transparent optimisation. The body is shared between
                copies of a string until such a time as a change is needed,
                at which point a copy is made. Such a COPY ON WRITE pattern
                (a specialisation of LAZY EVALUATION) requires the use of a
                hidden reference counted body.</li>

                <li><i>Explicit</i>: Here the body is of interest and the
                handle merely provides intelligence for its access and
                housekeeping. In C++ this is often implemented as the SMART
                POINTER idiom. One such application is that of reference
                counted smart pointers that collaborate to keep a count of an
                object, deleting it when the count falls to zero.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Attached vs detached</h2>

              <p>For reference counted smart pointers there are two places
              the count can exist, resulting in two different patterns, both
              outlined in <i>Software Patterns</i> [Coplien, SIGS, ISBN
              0-884842-50-X]:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>COUNTED BODY or ATTACHED COUNTED HANDLE/BODY places the
                count within the object being counted. The benefits are that
                countability is a part of the object being counted, and that
                reference counting does not require an additional object. The
                drawbacks are clearly that this is intrusive, and that the
                space for the reference count is wasted when the object is
                not heap based. Therefore the reference counting ties you to
                a particular implementation and style of use.</li>

                <li>DETACHED COUNTED HANDLE/BODY places the count outside the
                object being counted, such that they are handled together.
                The clear benefit of this is that this technique is
                completely unintrusive, with all of the intelligence and
                support apparatus in the smart pointer, and therefore can be
                used on classes created independently of the reference
                counted pointer. The main disadvantage is that frequent use
                of this can lead to a proliferation of small objects, i.e.
                the counter, being created on the heap.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>Even with this simple analysis, it seems that the DETACHED
              COUNTED HANDLE/BODY approach is ahead. Indeed, with the
              increasing use of templates this is often the favourite, and is
              the principle behind the common - but not standard -
              <code>counted_ptr</code>. <i>[The Boost name is <a href=
              "/doc/libs/release/libs/smart_ptr/shared_ptr.htm"><code>shared_ptr</code></a>
              rather than <code>counted_ptr</code>.]</i></p>

              <p>A common implementation of COUNTED BODY is to provide the
              counting mechanism in a base class that the counted type is
              derived from. Either that, or the reference counting mechanism
              is provided anew for each class that needs it. Both of these
              approaches are unsatisfactory because they are quite closed,
              coupling a class into a particular framework. Added to this the
              non-cohesiveness of having the count lying dormant in a
              non-counted object, and you get the feeling that excepting its
              use in widespread object models such as COM and CORBA the
              COUNTED BODY approach is perhaps only of use in specialised
              situations.</p>

              <h2>A requirements based approach</h2>

              <p>It is the question of openness that convinced me to revisit
              the problems with the COUNTED BODY idiom. Yes, there is a
              certain degree of intrusion expected when using this idiom, but
              is there anyway to minimise this and decouple the choice of
              counting mechanism from the smart pointer type used?</p>

              <p>In recent years the most instructive body of code and
              specification for constructing open general purpose components
              has been the Stepanov and Lee's STL (Standard Template
              Library), now part of the C++ standard library. The STL
              approach makes extensive use of compile time polymorphism based
              on well defined operational requirements for types. For
              instance, each container, contained and iterator type is
              defined by the operations that should be performable on an
              object of that type, often with annotations describing
              additional constraints. Compile time polymorphism, as its name
              suggests, resolves functions at compile time based on function
              name and argument usage, i.e. overloading. This is less
              intrusive, although less easily diagnosed if incorrect, than
              runtime poymorphism that is based on types, names and function
              signatures.</p>

              <p>This requirements based approach can be applied to reference
              counting. The operations we need for a type to be
              <i>Countable</i> are loosely:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>An <code>acquire</code> operation that registers interest
                in a <i>Countable</i> object.</li>

                <li>A <code>release</code> operation unregisters interest in
                a <i>Countable</i> object.</li>

                <li>An <code>acquired</code> query that returns whether or
                not a <i>Countable</i> object is currently acquired.</li>

                <li>A <code>dispose</code> operation that is responsible for
                disposing of an object that is no longer acquired.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>Note that the count is deduced as a part of the abstract
              state of this type, and is not mentioned or defined in any
              other way. The openness of this approach derives in part from
              the use of global functions, meaning that no particular member
              functions are implied; a perfect way to wrap up an existing
              counted body class without modifying the class itself. The
              other aspect to the openness comes from a more precise
              specification of the operations.</p>

              <p>For a type to be <i>Countable</i> it must satisfy the
              following requirements, where <code>ptr</code> is a non-null
              pointer to a single object (i.e. not an array) of the type, and
              <i><code>#function</code></i> indicates number of calls to
              <code><i>function(</i>ptr<i>)</i></code>:</p>

              <table border="1" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" summary="">
                <tr>
                  <td><i>Expression</i></td>

                  <td><i>Return type</i></td>

                  <td><i>Semantics and notes</i></td>
                </tr>

                <tr>
                  <td><code>acquire(ptr)</code></td>

                  <td>no requirement</td>

                  <td><i>post</i>: <code>acquired(ptr)</code></td>
                </tr>

                <tr>
                  <td><code>release(ptr)</code></td>

                  <td>no requirement</td>

                  <td><i>pre</i>: <code>acquired(ptr)<br /></code>
                  <i>post</i>: <code>acquired(ptr) == #acquire -
                  #release</code></td>
                </tr>

                <tr>
                  <td><code>acquired(ptr)</code></td>

                  <td>convertible to <code>bool</code></td>

                  <td><i>return</i>: <code>#acquire &gt; #release</code></td>
                </tr>

                <tr>
                  <td><code>dispose(ptr, ptr)</code></td>

                  <td>no requirement</td>

                  <td><i>pre</i>: <code>!acquired(ptr)<br /></code>
                  <i>post</i>: <code>*ptr</code> no longer usable</td>
                </tr>
              </table>

              <p>Note that the two arguments to <code>dispose</code> are to
              support selection of the appropriate type safe version of the
              function to be called. In the general case the intent is that
              the first argument determines the type to be deleted, and would
              typically be templated, while the second selects which template
              to use, e.g. by conforming to a specific base class.</p>

              <p>In addition the following requirements must also be
              satisfied, where <code>null</code> is a null pointer to the
              <i>Countable</i> type:</p>

              <table border="1" summary="">
                <tr>
                  <td><i>Expression</i></td>

                  <td><i>Return type</i></td>

                  <td><i>Semantics and notes</i></td>
                </tr>

                <tr>
                  <td><code>acquire(null)</code></td>

                  <td>no requirement</td>

                  <td><i>action</i>: none</td>
                </tr>

                <tr>
                  <td><code>release(null)</code></td>

                  <td>no requirement</td>

                  <td><i>action</i>: none</td>
                </tr>

                <tr>
                  <td><code>acquired(null)</code></td>

                  <td>convertible to <code>bool</code></td>

                  <td><i>return</i>: <code>false</code></td>
                </tr>

                <tr>
                  <td><code>dispose(null, null)</code></td>

                  <td>no requirement</td>

                  <td><i>action</i>: none</td>
                </tr>
              </table>

              <p>Note that there are no requirements on these functions in
              terms of exceptions thrown or not thrown, except that if
              exceptions are thrown the functions themselves should be
              exception safe.</p>

              <h2>Getting smart</h2>

              <p>Given the <i>Countable</i> requirements for a type, it is
              possible to define a generic smart pointer type that uses them
              for reference counting:</p>
              <pre>
template&lt;typename countable_type&gt;
class countable_ptr
{
public: // construction and destruction

    explicit countable_ptr(countable_type *);
    countable_ptr(const countable_ptr &amp;);
    ~countable_ptr();

public: // access

    countable_type *operator-&gt;() const;
    countable_type &amp;operator*() const;
    countable_type *get() const;

public: // modification

    countable_ptr &amp;clear();
    countable_ptr &amp;assign(countable_type *);
    countable_ptr &amp;assign(const countable_ptr &amp;);
    countable_ptr &amp;operator=(const countable_ptr &amp;);

private: // representation

    countable_type *body;

};
</pre>

              <p>The interface to this class has been kept intentionally
              simple, e.g. member templates and <code>throw</code> specs have
              been omitted, for exposition. The majority of the functions are
              quite simple in implementation, relying very much on the
              <code>assign</code> member as a keystone function:</p>
              <pre>
template&lt;typename countable_type&gt;
countable_ptr&lt;countable_type&gt;::countable_ptr(countable_type *initial)
  : body(initial)
{
    acquire(body);
}

template&lt;typename countable_type&gt;
countable_ptr&lt;countable_type&gt;::countable_ptr(const countable_ptr &amp;other)
  : body(other.body)
{
    acquire(body);
}

template&lt;typename countable_type&gt;
countable_ptr&lt;countable_type&gt;::~countable_ptr()
{
    clear();
}

template&lt;typename countable_type&gt;
countable_type *countable_ptr&lt;countable_type&gt;::operator-&gt;() const
{
    return body;
}

template&lt;typename countable_type&gt;
countable_type &amp;countable_ptr&lt;countable_type&gt;::operator*() const
{
    return *body;
}

template&lt;typename countable_type&gt;
countable_type *countable_ptr&lt;countable_type&gt;::get() const
{
    return body;
}

template&lt;typename countable_type&gt;
countable_ptr&lt;countable_type&gt; &amp;countable_ptr&lt;countable_type&gt;::clear()
{
    return assign(0);
}

template&lt;typename countable_type&gt;
countable_ptr&lt;countable_type&gt; &amp;countable_ptr&lt;countable_type&gt;::assign(countable_type *rhs)
{
    // set to rhs (uses Copy Before Release idiom which is self assignment safe)
    acquire(rhs);
    countable_type *old_body = body;
    body = rhs;

    // tidy up
    release(old_body);
    if(!acquired(old_body))
    {
        dispose(old_body, old_body);
    }

    return *this;
}

template&lt;typename countable_type&gt;
countable_ptr&lt;countable_type&gt; &amp;countable_ptr&lt;countable_type&gt;::assign(const countable_ptr &amp;rhs)
{
    return assign(rhs.body);
}

template&lt;typename countable_type&gt;
countable_ptr&lt;countable_type&gt; &amp;countable_ptr&lt;countable_type&gt;::operator=(const countable_ptr &amp;rhs)
{
    return assign(rhs);
}
</pre>

              <h2>Public accountability</h2>

              <p>Conformance to the requirements means that a type can be
              used with <code>countable_ptr</code>. Here is an implementation
              mix-in class (<i>mix-imp</i>) that confers countability on its
              derived classes through member functions. This class can be
              used as a class adaptor:</p>
              <pre>
class countability
{
public: // manipulation

    void acquire() const;
    void release() const;
    size_t acquired() const;

protected: // construction and destruction

    countability();
    ~countability();

private: // representation

    mutable size_t count;

private: // prevention

    countability(const countability &amp;);
    countability &amp;operator=(const countability &amp;);

};
</pre>

              <p>Notice that the manipulation functions are
              <code>const</code> and that the <code>count</code> member
              itself is <code>mutable</code>. This is because countability is
              not a part of an object's abstract state: memory management
              does not depend on the <code>const</code>-ness or otherwise of
              an object. I won't include the definitions of the member
              functions here as you can probably guess them: increment,
              decrement and return the current count, respectively for the
              manipulation functions. In a multithreaded environment you
              should ensure that such read and write operations are
              atomic.</p>

              <p>So how do we make this class <i>Countable</i>? A simple set
              of forwarding functions does the job:</p>
              <pre>
void acquire(const countability *ptr)
{
    if(ptr)
    {
        ptr-&gt;acquire();
    }
}

void release(const countability *ptr)
{
    if(ptr)
    {
        ptr-&gt;release();
    }
}

size_t acquired(const countability *ptr)
{
    return ptr ? ptr-&gt;acquired() : 0;
}

template&lt;class countability_derived&gt;
void dispose(const countability_derived *ptr, const countability *)
{
    delete ptr;
}
</pre>

              <p>Any type that now derives from <code>countability</code> may
              now be used with <code>countable_ptr</code>:</p>
              <pre>
class example : public countability
{
    ...
};

void simple()
{
    countable_ptr&lt;example&gt; ptr(new example);
    countable_ptr&lt;example&gt; qtr(ptr);
    ptr.clear(); // set ptr to point to null
}   // allocated object deleted when qtr destructs
</pre>

              <h2>Runtime mixin</h2>

              <p>The challenge is to apply COUNTED BODY in a non-intrusive
              fashion, such that there is no overhead when an object is not
              counted. What we would like to do is confer this capability on
              a per object rather than on a per class basis. Effectively we
              are after <i>Countability</i> on any object, i.e. anything
              pointed to by a <code>void *</code>! It goes without saying
              that <code>void</code> is perhaps the least committed of any
              type.</p>

              <p>The forces to resolve on this are quite interesting, to say
              the least. Interesting, but not insurmountable. Given that the
              class of a runtime object cannot change dynamically in any well
              defined manner, and the layout of the object must be fixed, we
              have to find a new place and time to add the counting state.
              The fact that this must be added only on heap creation suggests
              the following solution:</p>
              <pre>
struct countable_new;
extern const countable_new countable;

void *operator new(size_t, const countable_new &amp;);
void operator delete(void *, const countable_new &amp;);
</pre>

              <p>We have overloaded <code>operator new</code> with a dummy
              argument to distinguish it from the regular global
              <code>operator new</code>. This is comparable to the use of the
              <code>std::nothrow_t</code> type and <code>std::nothrow</code>
              object in the standard library. The placement <code>operator
              delete</code> is there to perform any tidy up in the event of
              failed construction. Note that this is not yet supported on all
              that many compilers.</p>

              <p>The result of a <code>new</code> expression using
              <code>countable</code> is an object allocated on the heap that
              has a header block that holds the count, i.e. we have extended
              the object by prefixing it. We can provide a couple of features
              in an anonymous namespace (not shown) in the implementation
              file for for supporting the count and its access from a raw
              pointer:</p>
              <pre>
struct count
{
    size_t value;
};

count *header(const void *ptr)
{
    return const_cast&lt;count *&gt;(static_cast&lt;const count *&gt;(ptr) - 1);
}
</pre>

              <p>An important constraint to observe here is the alignment of
              <code>count</code> should be such that it is suitably aligned
              for any type. For the definition shown this will be the case on
              almost all platforms. However, you may need to add a padding
              member for those that don't, e.g. using an anonymous
              <code>union</code> to coalign <code>count</code> and the most
              aligned type. Unfortunately, there is no portable way of
              specifying this such that the minimum alignment is also
              observed - this is a common problem when specifying your own
              allocators that do not directly use the results of either
              <code>new</code> or <code>malloc</code>.</p>

              <p>Again, note that the count is not considered to be a part of
              the logical state of the object, and hence the conversion from
              <code>const</code> to non-<code>const</code> -
              <code>count</code> is in effect a <code>mutable</code>
              type.</p>

              <p>The allocator functions themselves are fairly
              straightforward:</p>
              <pre>
void *operator new(size_t size, const countable_new &amp;)
{
    count *allocated = static_cast&lt;count *&gt;(::operator new(sizeof(count) + size));
    *allocated = count(); // initialise the header
    return allocated + 1; // adjust result to point to the body
}

void operator delete(void *ptr, const countable_new &amp;)
{
    ::operator delete(header(ptr));
}
</pre>

              <p>Given a correctly allocated header, we now need the
              <i>Countable</i> functions to operate on <code>const void
              *</code> to complete the picture:</p>
              <pre>
void acquire(const void *ptr)
{
    if(ptr)
    {
        ++header(ptr)-&gt;value;
    }
}

void release(const void *ptr)
{
    if(ptr)
    {
        --header(ptr)-&gt;value;
    }
}

size_t acquired(const void *ptr)
{
    return ptr ? header(ptr)-&gt;value : 0;
}

template&lt;typename countable_type&gt;
void dispose(const countable_type *ptr, const void *)
{
    ptr-&gt;~countable_type();
    operator delete(const_cast&lt;countable_type *&gt;(ptr), countable);
}
</pre>

              <p>The most complex of these is the <code>dispose</code>
              function that must ensure that the correct type is destructed
              and also that the memory is collected from the correct offset.
              It uses the value and type of first argument to perform this
              correctly, and the second argument merely acts as a strategy
              selector, i.e. the use of <code>const void *</code>
              distinguishes it from the earlier dispose shown for <code>const
              countability *</code>.</p>

              <h2>Getting smarter</h2>

              <p>Now that we have a way of adding countability at creation
              for objects of any type, what extra is needed to make this work
              with the <code>countable_ptr</code> we defined earlier? Good
              news: nothing!</p>
              <pre>
class example
{
    ...
};

void simple()
{
    countable_ptr&lt;example&gt; ptr(new(countable) example);
    countable_ptr&lt;example&gt; qtr(ptr);
    ptr.clear(); // set ptr to point to null
}   // allocated object deleted when qtr destructs
</pre>

              <p>The <code>new(countable)</code> expression defines a
              different policy for allocation and deallocation and, in common
              with other allocators, any attempt to mix your allocation
              policies, e.g. call <code>delete</code> on an object allocated
              with <code>new(countable)</code>, results in undefined
              behaviour. This is similar to what happens when you mix
              <code>new[]</code> with <code>delete</code> or
              <code>malloc</code> with <code>delete</code>. The whole point
              of <i>Countable</i> conformance is that <i>Countable</i>
              objects are used with <code>countable_ptr</code>, and this
              ensures the correct use.</p>

              <p>However, accidents will happen, and inevitably you may
              forget to allocate using <code>new(countable)</code> and
              instead use <code>new</code>. This error and others can be
              detected in most cases by extending the code shown here to add
              a check member to the <code>count</code>, validating the check
              on every access. A benefit of ensuring clear separation between
              header and implementation source files means that you can
              introduce a checking version of this allocator without having
              to recompile your code.</p>

              <h2>Conclusion</h2>

              <p>There are two key concepts that this article has
              introduced:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>The use of a generic requirements based approach to
                simplify and adapt the use of the COUNTED BODY pattern.</li>

                <li>The ability, through control of allocation, to
                dynamically and non-intrusively add capabilities to fixed
                types using the RUNTIME MIXIN pattern.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>The application of the two together gives rise to a new
              variant of the essential COUNTED BODY pattern, UNINTRUSIVE
              COUNTED BODY. You can take this theme even further and contrive
              a simple garbage collection system for C++.</p>

              <p>The complete code for <code>countable_ptr</code>,
              <code>countability</code>, and the <code>countable new</code>
              is also available.</p>
