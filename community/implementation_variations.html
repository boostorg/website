              <h2>Separation of interface and implementation</h2>

              <p>The interface specifications for boost.org library
              components (as well as for quality software in general) are
              conceptually separate from implementations of those interfaces.
              This may not be obvious, particularly when a component is
              implemented entirely within a header, but this separation of
              interface and implementation is always assumed. From the
              perspective of those concerned with software design,
              portability, and standardization, the interface is what is
              important, while the implementation is just a detail.</p>

              <p>Dietmar K&uuml;hl, one of the original boost.org
              contributors, comments "The main contribution is the interface,
              which is augmented with an implementation, proving that it is
              possible to implement the corresponding class and providing a
              free implementation."</p>

              <h2>Implementation variations</h2>

              <p>There may be a need for multiple implementations of an
              interface, to accommodate either platform dependencies or
              performance tradeoffs. Examples of platform dependencies
              include compiler shortcomings, file systems, thread mechanisms,
              and graphical user interfaces. The classic example of a
              performance tradeoff is a fast implementation which uses a lot
              of memory versus a slower implementation which uses less
              memory.</p>

              <p>Boost libraries generally use a <a href=
              "/doc/libs/release/libs/config/config.htm">configuration
              header</a>, boost/config.hpp, to capture compiler and platform
              dependencies. Although the use of boost/config.hpp is not
              required, it is the preferred approach for simple configuration
              problems.</p>

              <h2>Boost policy</h2>

              <p>The Boost policy is to avoid platform dependent variations
              in interface specifications, but supply implementations which
              are usable over a wide range of platforms and applications.
              That means boost libraries will use the techniques below
              described as appropriate for dealing with platform
              dependencies.</p>

              <p>The Boost policy toward implementation variations designed
              to enhance performance is to avoid them unless the benefits
              greatly exceed the full costs. The term "full costs" is
              intended to include both tangible costs like extra maintenance,
              and intangible cost like increased difficulty in user
              understanding.</p>

              <h2>Techniques for providing implementation variations</h2>

              <p>Several techniques may be used to provide implementation
              variations. Each is appropriate in some situations, and not
              appropriate in other situations.</p>

              <h3>Single general purpose implementation</h3>

              <p>The first technique is to simply not provide implementation
              variation at all. Instead, provide a single general purpose
              implementation, and forgo the increased complexity implied by
              all other techniques.</p>

              <p><strong>Appropriate:</strong> When it is possible to write a
              single portable implementation which has reasonable performance
              across a wide range of platforms. Particularly appropriate when
              alternative implementations differ only in esoteric ways.</p>

              <p><strong>Not appropriate:</strong> When implementation
              requires platform specific features, or when there are multiple
              implementation possible with widely differing performance
              characteristics.</p>

              <p>Beman Dawes comments "In design discussions some
              implementation is often alleged to be much faster than another,
              yet a timing test discovers no significant difference. The
              lesson is that while algorithmic differences may affect speed
              dramatically, coding differences such as changing a class from
              virtual to non-virtual members or removing a level of
              indirection are unlikely to make any measurable difference
              unless deep in an inner loop. And even in an inner loop, modern
              CPUs often execute such competing code sequences in the same
              number of clock cycles! A single general purpose implementation
              is often just fine."</p>

              <p>Or as Donald Knuth said, "Premature optimization is the root
              of all evil." (Computing Surveys, vol 6, #4, p 268).</p>

              <h3>Macros</h3>

              <p>While the evils of macros are well known, there remain a few
              cases where macros are the preferred solution:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Preventing multiple inclusion of headers via #include
                guards.</li>

                <li>Passing minor configuration information from a
                configuration header to other files.</li>
              </ul>

              <p><strong>Appropriate:</strong> For small compile-time
              variations which would otherwise be costly or confusing to
              install, use, or maintain. More appropriate to communicate
              within and between library components than to communicate with
              library users.</p>

              <p><strong>Not appropriate:</strong> If other techniques will
              do.</p>

              <p>To minimize the negative aspects of macros:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Only use macros when they are clearly superior to other
                techniques. They should be viewed as a last resort.</li>

                <li>Names should be all uppercase, and begin with the
                namespace name. This will minimize the chance of name
                collisions. For example, the #include guard for a boost
                header called foobar.h might be named BOOST_FOOBAR_H.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Separate files</h3>

              <p>A library component can have multiple variations, each
              contained in its own separate file or files. The files for the
              most appropriate variation are copied to the appropriate
              include or implementation directories at installation time.</p>

              <p>The way to provide this approach in boost libraries is to
              include specialized implementations as separate files in
              separate sub-directories in the .ZIP distribution file. For
              example, the structure within the .ZIP distribution file for a
              library named foobar which has both default and specialized
              variations might look something like:</p>
              <pre>
foobar.h                // The default header file
foobar.cpp              // The default implementation file
readme.txt              // Readme explains when to use which files
self_contained/foobar.h // A variation with everything in the header
linux/foobar.cpp        // Implementation file to replace the default
win32/foobar.h          // Header file to replace the default
win32/foobar.cpp        // Implementation file to replace the default
</pre>

              <p><strong>Appropriate:</strong> When different platforms
              require different implementations, or when there are major
              performance differences between possible implementations.</p>

              <p><strong>Not appropriate:</strong> When it makes sense to use
              more that one of the variations in the same installation.</p>

              <h3>Separate components</h3>

              <p>Rather than have several implementation variations of a
              single component, supply several separate components. For
              example, the Boost library currently supplies
              <code>scoped_ptr</code> and <code>shared_ptr</code> classes
              rather than a single <code>smart_ptr</code> class parameterized
              to distinguish between the two cases. There are several ways to
              make the component choice:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Hardwired by the programmer during coding.</li>

                <li>Chosen by programmer written runtime logic (trading off
                some extra space, time, and program complexity for the
                ability to select the implementation at run-time.)</li>
              </ul>

              <p><strong>Appropriate:</strong> When the interfaces for the
              variations diverge, and when it is reasonably to use more than
              one of the variations. When run-time selection of
              implementation is called for.</p>

              <p><strong>Not appropriate:</strong> When the variations are
              data type, traits, or specialization variations which can be
              better handled by making the component a template. Also not
              appropriate when choice of variation is best done by some setup
              or installation mechanism outside of the program itself. Thus
              usually not appropriate to cope with platform differences.</p>

              <p><strong>Note:</strong> There is a related technique where
              the interface is specified as an abstract (pure virtual) base
              class (or an interface definition language), and the
              implementation choice is passed off to some third-party, such
              as a dynamic-link library or object-request broker. While that
              is a powerful technique, it is way beyond the scope of this
              discussion.</p>

              <h3>Template-based approaches</h3>

              <p>Turning a class or function into a template is often an
              elegant way to cope with variations. Template-based approaches
              provide optimal space and time efficiency in return for
              constraining the implementation selection to compile time.</p>

              <p>Important template techniques include:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Data type parameterization. This allows a single
                component to operate on a variety of data types, and is why
                templates were originally invented.</li>

                <li>Traits parameterization. If parameterization is complex,
                bundling up aspects into a single traits helper class can
                allow great variation while hiding messy details. The C++
                Standard Library provides several examples of this idiom,
                such as <code>iterator_traits&lt;&gt;</code> (24.3.1
                lib.iterator.traits) and <tt>char_traits&lt;&gt;</tt> (21.2
                lib.char.traits).</li>

                <li>Specialization. A template parameter can be used purely
                for the purpose of selecting a specialization. For
                example:</li>
              </ul>
              <pre>
SomeClass&lt;fast&gt;  my_fast_object;  // fast and small are empty classes
SomeClass&lt;small&gt; my_small_object; // used just to select specialization
</pre>

              <p><strong>Appropriate:</strong> When the need for variation is
              due to data type or traits, or is performance related like
              selecting among several algorithms, and when a program might
              reasonably use more than one of the variations.</p>

              <p><strong>Not appropriate:</strong> When the interfaces for
              variations are different, or when choice of variation is best
              done by some mechanism outside of the program itself. Thus
              usually not appropriate to cope with platform differences.</p>
