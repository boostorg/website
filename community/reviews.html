              <h2><a name="Introduction" id=
              "Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>

              <p>Proposed libraries are accepted into Boost only after
              undergoing a formal review, where Boost mailing list members
              comment on their evaluation of the library.</p>

              <p>The final "accept" or "reject" decision is made by the
              <a href="#Review_Manager">Review Manager</a>, based on the
              review comments received from boost mailing list members.</p>

              <p>Boost mailing list members are encouraged to submit Formal
              Review comments:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Publicly on the mailing list.</li>

                <li>Privately to the Review Manager.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>Private comments to a library submitter may be helpful to
              her or him, but won't help the Review Manager reach a decision,
              so the other forms are preferred.</p>

              <h2><a name="Comments" id="Comments"></a>What to include in
              Review Comments</h2>

              <p>Your comments may be brief or lengthy, but basically the
              Review Manager needs your evaluation of the library. If you
              identify problems along the way, please note if they are minor,
              serious, or showstoppers.</p>

              <p>Here are some questions you might want to answer in your
              review:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>What is your evaluation of the design?</li>

                <li>What is your evaluation of the implementation?</li>

                <li>What is your evaluation of the documentation?</li>

                <li>What is your evaluation of the potential usefulness of
                the library?</li>

                <li>Did you try to use the library? With what compiler? Did
                you have any problems?</li>

                <li>How much effort did you put into your evaluation? A
                glance? A quick reading? In-depth study?</li>

                <li>Are you knowledgeable about the problem domain?</li>
              </ul>

              <p>And finally, every review should answer this question:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Do you think the library should be accepted as a Boost
                library? Be sure to say this explicitly so that your other
                comments don't obscure your overall opinion.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2><a name="Results" id="Results"></a>Results</h2>

              <p>At the conclusion of the comment period, the Review Manager
              will post a message to the mailing list saying if the library
              has been accepted or rejected. A rationale is also helpful, but
              its extent is up to the Review Manager. If there are
              suggestions, or conditions that must be met before final
              inclusion, they should be stated.</p>

              <h2><a name="Review_Manager" id="Review_Manager"></a>Notes for
              Review Managers</h2>

              <p>Before a library can be scheduled for formal review, an
              active boost member not connected with the library submission
              must volunteer to be the "Review Manager" for the library.</p>

              <p>The Review Manager:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Checks the submission to make sure it really is complete
                enough to warrant formal review. See the <a href=
                "lib_guide.htm">Boost Library Requirements and
                Guidelines</a>. If necessary, work with the submitter to
                verify the code compiles and runs correctly on several
                compilers and platforms.</li>

                <li>Finalizes the schedule with the <a href=
                "#Wizard"></a>Review Wizard and the submitter.</li>

                <li>Posts a notice of the review schedule on both the regular
                <strong><a href="mailto:boost@lists.boost.org" class=
                "external">boost mailing list</a></strong> and the
                <strong><a href="mailto:boost-announce@lists.boost.org"
                  class="external">boost-announce</a> mailing list</strong>.

                  <ul>
                    <li>The notice should include a brief description of the
                    library and what it does, to let readers know if the
                    library is one they are interested in reviewing.</li>

                    <li>If the library is known to fail with certain
                    compilers, please mention them in the review notice so
                    reviewers with those compilers won't waste time
                    diagnosing known problems.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>

                <li>Inspects the Boost <a href=
                "../libs/libraries.htm">library catalogue</a> for libraries
                which may interact with the new submission. These potential
                interactions should be pointed out in the review
                announcement, and the author(s) of these libraries should be
                privately notified and urged to participate in the
                review.</li>

                <li>Urges people to do reviews if they aren't
                forthcoming.</li>

                <li>Follows review discussions regarding the library,
                moderating or answering questions as needed.</li>

                <li>Decides if there is consensus to accept the library, and
                if there are any conditions attached.</li>

                <li>Posts a message on both the <strong><a href=
                "mailto:boost@lists.boost.org">boost</a></strong> and
                <strong><a href=
                "mailto:boost-announce@lists.boost.org">boost-announce</a></strong>
                lists informing members of the <a href="#Results">review
                results</a>.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>In other words, it is the Review Manager's responsibility to
              make sure the review process works smoothly.</p>

              <h2><a name="Submitters" id="Submitters"></a>Notes for Library
              Submitters</h2>

              <p>See <a href="submission_process.htm">Submission Process</a>
              for a description of the steps a library developer goes through
              to get a library accepted by Boost.</p>

              <p>A proposed library should remain stable during the review
              period; it will just confuse and irritate reviewers if there
              are numerous changes. It is, however, useful to upload fixes
              for serious bugs right away, particularly those which prevent
              reviewers from fully evaluating the library. Post a notice of
              such fixes on the mailing list.</p>

              <p>Library improvements suggested by reviewers should normally
              be held until after the completion of review period. If the
              suggested changes might affect reviewer's judgments, post a
              notice of the pending change on the mailing list.</p>

              <h2><a name="Wizard" id="Wizard"></a>Review Wizard</h2>

              <p>The Review Wizard coordinates the formal review
              schedule:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Maintains a list of review manager volunteers, in the
                form of a queue, so that volunteers who least recently
                managed reviews become the prime candidates for upcoming
                reviews.</li>

                <li>When a formal review is requested for a library:

                  <ul>
                    <li>Assign a review manager and suggests a schedule,
                    after checking (via private email) availability of the
                    volunteers at the top of review manager queue.</li>

                    <li>Finalize the schedule, once the review manager
                    verifies the library is actually ready for review.</li>

                    <li>Resolve schedule slips or other issues with review
                    managers and submitters.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>

                <li>Maintains a schedule of both past and pending reviews, in
                the form of the <a href="formal_review_schedule.html">Review
                Schedule</a> web page.</li>

                <li>Resolves questions from review managers and library
                submitters, who sometimes want a third opinion on questions
                such as "Should we extend the review period because
                ...?"</li>

                <li>Monitors the general review process, and makes minor
                adjustments as needed, or queries the list about possible
                major adjustments.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>The role of Boost Review Wizard is currently played by
              <a href="mailto:reportbase@yahoo.com" class="external">Tom
              Brinkman</a> and Ronald Garcia (garcia at cs dot indiana dot

              <h2><a name="Fast-Track" id="Fast-Track"></a>Fast Track
              Reviews</h2>

              <p>To qualify for fast track review:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>The component must be small.</li>

                <li>The technique must be already in use in Boost libraries
                and the new component provides a common implementation.</li>

                <li>A full Boost-conformant implementation is available in
                the sandbox.</li>

                <li>The Review Wizard determines that the proposal qualifies
                for fast track review.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>Procedure:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>The Boost Review Wizard posts a review announcement to
                the main Boost developer's list. The review period will
                normally last for 5 days. No two fast track reviews will run
                in parallel. Fast track reviews may run during full reviews,
                though generally this is to be avoided.</li>

                <li>After the review period ends, the submitter will post a
                review summary containing proposed changes to the reviewed
                implementation.</li>

                <li>The Review Wizard will accept or reject the proposed
                library and proposed changes.</li>

                <li>After applying the proposed changes, the component is
                checked into CVS like any other library.</li>
              </ul>
