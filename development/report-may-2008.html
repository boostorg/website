              <p>The binary_int library, accepted in October 2005 has not yet

              <p>The Scope Exit review report had not been submitted by the
              review manager. John Phillips stepped in as substitute review
              manager and produced a report</p>

              <p>For libraries that are still waiting to get into SVN, please
              get them ready and into the repository. The developers did some
              great work making the libraries, so don't miss the chance to
              share that work with others. Also notice that the review
              process page has been updated with a section on rights and
              responsibilities of library submitters.</p>

              <p>For the Scope Exit review, we would like to publicly
              apologize to Alexander Nasonov for how long this has languished
              without a report. The review wizards will work to make sure
              this doesn't happen any more.</p>

              <p>As always, we need experienced review managers. In the past
              few months there have been a large number of reviews, but the
              flow of high quality submissions is just as big, so manage
              reviews if possible and if not please make sure to watch the
              review schedule and participate. Please take a look at the list
              of libraries in need of managers and check out their
              descriptions. In general review managers are active boost
              participants or library contributors. If you can serve as
              review manager for any of them, email Ron Garcia or John
              Phillips, "garcia at cs dot indiana dot edu" and "phillips at
              mps dot ohio-state dot edu" respectively.</p>

              <p>A link to this report will be posted to www.boost.org. If
              you would like us to make any modifications or additions to
              this report before we do that, please email Ron or John.</p>

              <p>If you're a library author and plan on submitting a library
              for review in the next 3-6 months, send Ron or John a short
              description of your library and we'll add it to the Libraries
              Under Construction below. We know that there are many libraries
              that are near completion, but we have hard time keeping track
              all of them. Please keep us informed about your progress.</p>

                        <p class="first">The Boost.FSM library is an
                        implementation of FSM (stands for Finite State
                        Machine) programming concept. The main goals of the
                        library are:</p>

                        <ul class="last simple">
                          <li>Simplicity. It should be very simple to create
                          state machines using this library.</li>

                          <li>Performance. The state machine infrastructure
                          should not be very time and memory-consuming in
                          order to be applicable in more use cases.</li>

                          <li>Extensibility. A developer may want to add more
                          states to an existing state machine. A developer
                          should also be able to specify additional
                          transitions and events for the machine with minimum
                          modifications to the existing code.</li>

                          <li>Two new graph classes (undirected and directed)
                          which are intended to make the library more
                          approachable for new developers</li>

                          directed graph (Tiernan's from 1970ish). It works
                          for undirected graphs too, but reports cycles twice
                          (one for each direction).</li>

                          <li>An algorithm for visiting all the cliques a
                          graph (Bron&amp;Kerbosch). Works for both directed
                          and undirected.</li>

                          <li>Derived graph measures radius and diameter
                          (from eccentricity) and girth and circumference
                          (from Tiernan), and clique number (from
                          Bron&amp;Kerbosch).</li>

                          <li>An exterior_property class that helps hides
                          some of the weirdness with exterior
                          properties.</li>

                          <li>a substantial amount of documentation</li>

                          (@Stanford University)</li>

                          <li>Deterministic graph generators - capable of
                          creating or inducing specific types of graphs over
                          a vertex set (e.g., star graph, wheel graph, prism

                        (sub-)thread and provides the value in another
                        (controlling) thread. This buffer provides
                        essentially two interfaces:</p>

                        <blockquote>

                            <li>an interface to wait for, query and retrieve
                            the value (or exception) from the buffer as
                            classes unique_future and shared_future. While a

                            the shared_future provides copy semantics where
                            the value can be retrieved arbitrarily

                        <p>A typical procedure for working with promises and
                        futures looks like:</p>

                        <blockquote>
                          <ul class="simple">
                            <li>control thread creates a promise,</li>

                            <li>control thread gets associated future from
                            promise,</li>

                            <li>control thread starts sub-thread,</li>

                            <li>sub-thread calls actual function and assigns
                            the return value to the promise,</li>

                            <li>control thread waits for future to become
                            ready,</li>

                            <li>control thread retrieves value from
                            future.</li>
                          </ul>
                        </blockquote>

                        <p>Also proposed is a packaged_task that wraps one
                        callable object and provides another one that can be
                        started in its own thread and assigns the return
                        value (or exception) to a return buffer that can be
                        accessed through one of the future classes.</p>

                        <p>With a packaged_task a typical procedure looks
                        like:</p>

                        <blockquote class="last">
                          <ul class="simple">
                            <li>control thread creates a packaged_task with a
                            callable object,</li>

                            <li>control thread gets associated future from
                            packaged_task,</li>

                            <li>control thread starts sub-thread, which
                            invokes the packaged_task,</li>

                            <li>packaged_task calls the callable function and
                            assigns the return value,</li>

                            <li>control thread waits for future to become
                            ready,</li>

                            <li>control thread retrieves value from
                            future.</li>
                          </ul>

                <p>Notice that we are in the unusual position of having two
                very different libraries with the same goal in the queue at
                the same time. The Review Wizards would appreciate a
                discussion of the best way to hold these two reviews to
                produce the best possible addition to Boost.</p>

                      applications. It follows Comega's design and
