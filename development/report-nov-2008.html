<h1>Older Issues</h1>
<p>The Quantitative Units library, accepted in April 2007 is in SVN
(listed as units).</p>
<p>The Time Series Library, accepted in August 2007, has not yet been
submitted
to SVN.</p>
<p>The Switch Library, accepted provisionally in January 2008,
has not yet been submitted for mini-review and full acceptance.</p>
<p>Property Map (Fast-Track) and Graph (Fast-Track) have been removed
from the review queue.  The author (Andrew Sutton) intends to submit a
new version of this work at a later time.</p>
<p>A few libraries have been reviewed and accepted into boost, but have
not yet appeared in SVN as far as I can tell.  Could some light be
shed on the status of the following libraries? Apologies if I have
simply overlooked any of them:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Flyweight (Joaquin Ma Lopez Munoz)</li>
<li>Floating Point Utilities (Johan Rade)</li>
<li>Factory (Tobias Schwinger)</li>
<li>Forward (Tobias Schwinger)</li>
<li>Scope Exit (Alexander Nasonov)</li>
<li>Time Series (Eric Niebler)</li>
<li>Property Tree (Marcin Kalicinski) -- No documentation in SVN</li>
</ul>
<p>Any information on the whereabouts of these libraries would be greatly
appreciated.</p>
<p>For libraries that are still waiting to get into SVN, please get them
ready and into the repository. The developers did some great work
making the libraries, so don't miss the chance to share that work with
others. Also notice that the review process page has been updated with
a section on rights and responsibilities of library submitters.</p>

<div class="section" id="general-announcements">
<h1>General Announcements</h1>
<p>As always, we need experienced review managers.  The review queue has
been growing substantially but we have had few volunteers, so manage
reviews if possible and if not please make sure to watch the review
schedule and participate. Please take a look at the list of libraries
in need of managers and check out their descriptions. In general
review managers are active boost participants or library
contributors. If you can serve as review manager for any of them,
email Ron Garcia or John Phillips, &quot;garcia at osl dot iu dot edu&quot;
and &quot;phillips at mps dot ohio-state dot edu&quot; respectively.</p>
<p>We are also suffering from a lack of reviewers. While we all
understand time pressures and the need to complete paying work, the
strength of Boost is based on the detailed and informed reviews
submitted by you. A recent effort is trying to secure at least five
people who promise to submit reviews as a precondition to starting
the review period. Consider volunteering for this and even taking the
time to create the review as early as possible. No rule says you can
only work on a review during the review period.</p>
<p>A link to this report will be posted to www.boost.org. If you would
like us to make any modifications or additions to this report before
we do that, please email Ron or John.</p>
<p>If you're a library author and plan on submitting a library for review
in the next 3-6 months, send Ron or John a short description of your
library and we'll add it to the Libraries Under Construction below. We
know that there are many libraries that are near completion, but we
have hard time keeping track all of them. Please keep us informed
about your progress.</p>

destination), to very complex (multiple logs, some enabled/some
not, levels, etc).  It features a very simple and flexible
interface, efficient filtering of messages, thread-safety,
formatters and destinations, easy manipulation of logs, finding
the best logger/filter classes based on your application's
needs, you can define your own macros and much more!</td>

<tr class="field"><th class="field-name">Description:</th><td class="field-body"><p class="first">This library proposes a kind of return buffer that takes
a value (or an exception) in one (sub-)thread and provides the value
in another (controlling) thread.  This buffer provides essentially
two interfaces:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>an interface to assign a value as class promise and</li>
<li>an interface to wait for, query and retrieve the value (or exception)
from the buffer as classes unique_future and shared_future.  While a
unique_future provides move semantics where the value (or exception)
can be retrieved only once, the shared_future provides copy semantics
where the value can be retrieved arbitrarily often.</li>
</ul>
<p>A typical procedure for working with promises and futures looks like:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>control thread creates a promise,</li>
<li>control thread gets associated future from promise,</li>
<li>control thread starts sub-thread,</li>
<li>sub-thread calls actual function and assigns the return value to
the promise,</li>
<li>control thread waits for future to become ready,</li>
<li>control thread retrieves value from future.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also proposed is a packaged_task that wraps one callable object and
provides another one that can be started in its own thread and assigns
the return value (or exception) to a return buffer that can be
accessed through one of the future classes.</p>
<p>With a packaged_task a typical procedure looks like:</p>
<ul class="last simple">
<li>control thread creates a packaged_task with a callable object,</li>
<li>control thread gets associated future from packaged_task,</li>
<li>control thread starts sub-thread, which invokes the packaged_task,</li>
<li>packaged_task calls the callable function and assigns the return value,</li>
<li>control thread waits for future to become ready,</li>

<tr class="field"><th class="field-name">Description:</th><td class="field-body"><p class="first">The Boost Constrained Value library contains class templates useful
for creating constrained objects. A simple example is an object
representing an hour of a day, for which only integers from the range
[0, 23] are valid values:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
bounded_int&lt;int, 0, 23&gt;::type hour;
hour = 20; // OK
hour = 26; // exception!
</pre>
<p>Behavior in case of assignment of an invalid value can be customized. For
instance, instead of throwing an exception as in the example above, the value
may be adjusted to meet the constraint:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
wrapping_int&lt;int, 0, 255&gt;::type buffer_index;
buffer_index = 257; // OK: wraps the value to fit in the range
assert( buffer_index == 1 );
</pre>
<p>The library doesn't focus only on bounded objects as in the examples above --
virtually any constraint can be imposed by using a predicate:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
// constraint (a predicate)
struct is_odd {
   bool operator () (int i) const
   { return (i % 2) != 0; }
};
</pre>
<pre class="literal-block">
// and the usage is as simple as:
constrained&lt;int, is_odd&gt; odd_int = 1;
odd_int += 2; // OK
++odd_int; // exception!
</pre>
<p class="last">The library has a policy-based design to allow for flexibility in defining
constraints and behavior in case of assignment of invalid values. Policies may
be configured at compile-time for maximum efficiency or may be changeable at
runtime if such dynamic functionality is needed.</p>

<tr class="field"><th class="field-name">Description:</th><td class="field-body"><p class="first">The aim of the Mirror library is to provide useful meta-data at both
compile-time and run-time about common C++ constructs like namespaces,
types, typedef-ined types, classes and their base classes and member
attributes, instances, etc. and to provide generic interfaces for
their introspection.</p>
<p>Mirror is designed with the principle of stratification in mind and
tries to be as less intrusive as possible. New or existing classes do
not need to be designed to directly support Mirror and no Mirror
related code is necessary in the class' definition, as far as some
general guidelines are followed</p>
<p>Most important features of the Mirror library that are currently
implemented include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Namespace-name inspection.</li>
<li>Inspection of the whole scope in which a namespace is defined</li>
<li>Type-name querying, with the support for typedef-ined typenames
and typenames of derived types like pointers, references,
cv-qualified types, arrays, functions and template names. Names
with or without nested-name-specifiers can be queried.</li>
<li>Inspection of the scope in which a type has been defined</li>
<li>Uniform and generic inspection of class' base classes.  One can
inspect traits of the base classes for example their types,
whether they are inherited virtually or not and the access
specifier (private, protected, public).</li>
<li>Uniform and generic inspection of class' member attributes. At
compile-time the count of class' attributes and their types,
storage class specifiers (static, mutable) and some other traits
can be queried. At run-time one can uniformly query the names
and/or values (when given an instance of the reflected class) of
the member attributes and sequentially execute a custom functor
on every attribute of a class.</li>
<li>Traversals of a class' (or generally type's) structure with user
defined visitors, which are optionally working on an provided
instance of the type or just on it's structure without any
run-time data. These visitors are guided by Mirror through the
structure of the class and optionally provided with contextual
information about the current position in the traversal.</li>

<tr class="field"><th class="field-name">Description:</th><td class="field-body"><p class="first">The Interval Template Library (Itl) provides intervals
and two kinds of interval containers: Interval_sets and
interval_maps. Interval_sets and maps can be used just
as sets or maps of elements. Yet they are much more
space and time efficient when the elements occur in
contiguous chunks: intervals. This is obviously the case
in many problem domains, particularly in fields that deal
with problems related to date and time.</p>
<p>Interval containers allow for intersection with interval_sets
to work with segmentation. For instance you might want
to intersect an interval container with a grid of months
and then iterate over those months.</p>
<p>Finally interval_maps provide aggregation on
associated values, if added intervals overlap with
intervals that are stored in the interval_map. This
feature is called aggregate on overlap. It is shown by
example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
typedef set&lt;string&gt; guests;
interval_map&lt;time, guests&gt; party;
guests mary; mary.insert(&quot;Mary&quot;);
guests harry; harry.insert(&quot;Harry&quot;);
party += make_pair(interval&lt;time&gt;::rightopen(20:00, 22:00),mary);
party += make_pair(interval&lt;time&gt;::rightopen_(21:00, 23:00),harry);
// party now contains
[20:00, 21:00)-&gt;{&quot;Mary&quot;}
[21:00, 22:00)-&gt;{&quot;Harry&quot;,&quot;Mary&quot;} //guest sets aggregated on overlap
[22:00, 23:00)-&gt;{&quot;Harry&quot;}
</pre>
<p class="last">As can be seen from the example an interval_map has both
a decompositional behavior (on the time dimension) as well as
a accumulative one (on the associated values).</p>

<li>thread decorator: thread_decorator allows to define

thread: setup before the thread function and cleanup at thread
exit.</li>
<li>thread specific shared pointer: this is an extension of the
thread_specific_ptr providing access to this thread specific
context from other threads. As it is shared the stored pointer
is a shared_ptr instead of a raw one.</li>
<li>thread keep alive mechanism: this mechanism allows to detect
threads that do not prove that they are alive by calling to the
keep_alive_point regularly. When a thread is declared dead a
user provided function is called, which by default will abort
the program.</li>
<li>thread tuple: defines a thread groupe where the number of
threads is know statically and the threads are created at
construction time.</li>
<li>set_once: a synchonizer that allows to set a variable only once,
notifying to the variable value to whatever is waiting for that.</li>
<li>thread_tuple_once: an extension of the boost::thread_tuple which
allows to join the thread finishing the first, using for that
the set_once synchronizer.</li>

allows to join the thread finishing the first, using for that
