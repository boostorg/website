News
====

August 17, 2007 -- Time Series Accepted.
 Announcement: https://lists.boost.org/boost-announce/2007/08/0142.php

July 24, 2007 -- Boost Version 1.34.1 Released.
 This is a bug fix release addressing many problems with the 1.34.0 release.
 Announcement: http://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/query?status=closed&milestone=Boost+1.34.1

We need experienced review managers.  Please take a look at the list
of libraries in need of managers and check out their descriptions.  In
general review managers are active boost participants or library
contributors.  If you can serve as review manager for any of them,
email Ron Garcia or John Phillips, "garcia at cs dot indiana dot edu"
and "jphillip at capital dot edu" respectively.

A link to this report will be posted to www.boost.org.
If you would like us to make any modifications or additions to this
report before we do that, please email Ron or John.

If you're library author and plan on submitting a library for review
in the next 3-6 months, send Ron or John a short description of your
library and we'll add it to the Libraries Under Construction below.
We know that there are many libraries that are near completion, but we
have hard time keeping track all of them. Please keep us informed
about your progress.

Exception
---------
    :Author: Emil Dotchevski
    :Review Manager: Need Volunteer

    :Download:
      http://www.revergestudios.com/boost-exception/boost-exception.zip

    :Description: 
      The purpose of this library is to free designers of
      exception classes from having to consider what data needs to be
      stored in exception objects in order for the catch site to be
      able to make sense of what went wrong.

      When the exception class is used, arbitrary values can be stored
      in any exception. This can be done directly in the
      throw-expression, or at a later time as the exception object
      propagates up the call stack. The ability to add data to any
      exception object after it has been thrown is important, because
      often some of the information needed to handle an exception is
      unavailable at the time of the throw.


Finite State Machines
---------------------
    :Author: Andrey Semashev
    :Review Manager: Martin Vuille
    :Download: `Boost Sandbox Vault <http://tinyurl.com/yjozfn>`__ 

    :Description:

      The Boost.FSM library is an implementation of FSM (stands for
      Finite State Machine) programming concept. The main goals of the
      library are:

      * Simplicity. It should be very simple to create state machines using
	this library.
      * Performance. The state machine infrastructure should not be
	very time and memory-consuming in order to be applicable in
	more use cases.
      * Extensibility. A developer may want to add more states to an
	existing state machine.  A developer should also be able to
	specify additional transitions and events for the machine with
	minimum modifications to the existing code.


Floating Point Utilities
------------------------
    :Author: Johan Råde
    :Review Manager: Need Volunteer
    :Download:
      `Boost Sandbox Vault <http://boost-consulting.com/vault/index.php?directory=Math%20-%20Numerics>`__
      
    :Description: The Floating Point Utilities library contains the following:

     * Floating point number classification functions: fpclassify, isfinite, 
       isinf, isnan, isnormal (Follows TR1)
     * Sign bit functions: signbit, copysign, changesign (Follows TR1)
     * Facets that format and parse infinity and NaN according to the C99 
       standard. (These can be used for portable handling of infinity and NaN 
       in text streams.)


Switch
------
    :Author: Steven Watanabe
    :Review Manager: Need Volunteer
    :Download: 
      `Boost Sandbox Vault <http://boost-consulting.com/vault/index.php?action=downloadfile&filename=mcs_units_v0.7.1.zip&directory=Units>`__
      
    :Description:
      The built in C/C++ switch statement is very efficient. Unfortunately,
      unlike a chained if/else construct there is no easy way to use it when
      the number of cases depends on a template parameter. The Switch library 
      addresses this issue.


Property Map (fast-track)
-------------------------
    :Author: Andrew Sutton
    :Review Manager: Jeremy Siek
    :Download: http://svn.boost.org/svn/boost/sandbox/graph-v2
    :Description:
      A number of additions and modifications to the Property Map Library, 
      including: 

       * A constant-valued property map, useful for naturally unweighted  
	 graphs.
       * A noop-writing property map, useful when you have to provide an  
	 argument, but just don't care about the output.
       * See 
	 `ChangeLog <http://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/browser/sandbox/graph-v2/libs/property_map/ChangeLog>`__
	 for details.


Graph (fast-track)
------------------
    :Author: Andrew Sutton
    :Review Manager: Jeremy Siek
    :Download: http://svn.boost.org/svn/boost/sandbox/graph-v2
    :Description:
     A number of additions and modifications to the Graph Library, 
     including: 

     * Two new graph classes (undirected and directed) which are intended  
       to make the library more approachable for new developers
     * A suite of graph measures including degree and closeness  
       centrality, mean geodesic distance, eccentricity, and clustering  
       coefficients.
     * An algorithm for visiting all cycles in a directed graph (Tiernan's  
       from 1970ish). It works for undirected graphs too, but reports cycles  
       twice (one for each direction).
     * An algorithm for visiting all the cliques a graph (Bron&Kerbosch).  
       Works for both directed and undirected.
     * Derived graph measures radius and diameter (from eccentricity) and  
       girth and circumference (from Tiernan), and clique number (from  
       Bron&Kerbosch).
     * An exterior_property class that helps hides some of the weirdness  
       with exterior properties.
     * runtime and compile-time tests for the new algorithms.
     * a substantial amount of documentation 
     * Graph cores, implemented by David Gleich (@Stanford University)
     * Deterministic graph generators - capable of creating or inducing  
       specific types of graphs over a vertex set (e.g., star graph, wheel  
       graph, prism graph, etc). There are several other specific types that  
       could be added to this, but I haven't had the time just yet.


Libraries under development
===========================

Dataflow
--------
    :Author: Stjepan Rajko

    :Description:
      The Dataflow library provides generic support for data
      producers, consumers, and connections between the two.  It also
      provides layers for several specific dataflow mechanisms, namely
      Boost.Signals, VTK data/display pipelines, and plain
      pointers. The Dataflow library came out of the Signal Network
      GSoC project, mentored by Doug Gregor.

    :Status:
      I am polishing the Dataflow library for submission, and am expecting
      to add it to the review queue in the next couple of months.  
      I am currently ironing out some faults in the design of the library,
      filling in missing features, and testing it on / adapting it to
      different dataflow mechanisms (currently VTK and soon
      Boost.Iostreams).  As soon as I'm pretty sure that things are going
      the right way, I'll submit this to the review queue while I do the
      finishing touches.


Constrained Value
-----------------
    :Author: Robert Kawulak

    :Download:
      http://rk.go.pl/f/constrained_value.zip

      http://rk.go.pl/r/constrained_value (Documentation)

    :Description:
      The Constrained Value library contains class templates 
      useful for creating constrained objects. The simplest example 
      of a constrained object is hour. The only valid values for an hour 
      within a day are integers from the range [0, 23]. With this library, 
      you can create a variable which behaves exactly like int, but does 
      not allow for assignment of values which do not belong to the 
      allowed range. The library doesn't focus only on constrained 
      objects that hold a value belonging to a specified range (i.e., 
      bounded objects). Virtually any constraint can be imposed using 
      appropriate predicate. You can specify what happens in case of 
      assignment of an invalid value, e.g. an exception may be thrown or 
      the value may be adjusted to meet the constraint criterions.

    :Status: I'm planning to finish it in 1-2 months.


Please let us know of any libraries you are currently
developing that you intend to submit for review.
