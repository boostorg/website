              <h2><a name="Learn" id="Learn"></a>Learn about Boost</h2>

              <p>Subscribe to the <a href="/community/groups.html#main">main
              developers mailing list</a> for a while, or look through the
              <a href="/community/groups.html#archive">archives</a>. Click
              around the <a href="/">web site</a>. Understand the <a href=
              "requirements.html">Requirements</a>. Read the rest of this
              page to learn about the process. Otherwise, you will just end
              up wasting everyone's time.</p>

              <p>There is a culture associated with Boost, aimed at
              encouraging high quality libraries by a process of discussion
              and refinement.</p>

              <p>If what you really want is a site that will just post your
              library without even looking at it, you should go
              elsewhere.</p>

              <h2><a name="interest" id="interest"></a>Determine
              interest</h2>

              <p>Potential library submitters should use the Boost developers
              <a href="/community/groups.html">mailing list</a> as a forum to
              gauge interest a possible submission.</p>

              <p>A message might be as simple as "Is there any interest in a
              library which solves Travelling Salesperson problems in linear
              time?"</p>

              <p>A bit of further description or snippet of code may be
              helpful. Messages should be plain text; not rich text, HTML,
              etc.</p>

              <p>Please don't post lengthy descriptions, documentation, or
              code to the mailing list, and no attachments, even small ones.
              Please make lengthy material available on the web. You can use
              a project hosting service such as sourceforge, github, google
              code, bitbucket etc.</p>

              <h2><a name="Preliminary" id="Preliminary"></a>Preliminary
              submission</h2>

              <p>If response to an initial query indicates interest, then
              make your preliminary submission publicly available if you
              haven't already done so.</p>

              <h2><a name="Refinement" id="Refinement"></a>Refinement</h2>

              <p>Discuss, refine, resubmit. Repeat until satisfied.</p>

              <p>The exact details of this process varies a lot. Sometimes it
              is public, on the mailing list, sometimes a lot of discussion
              happens in private emails. For some libraries the process is
              over quickly, for others it goes on for months.&nbsp; It's
              often challenging, and sometimes leads off in completely
              unexpected directions.</p>

              <p>The <a href="/community/groups.html#archive">archive</a> of
              past messages is one way to see how this process worked for
              other Boost libraries.</p>

              <h2><a name="Submission" id="Submission"></a>Submission for
              review</h2>

              <p>All of the files which make up the library should be
              combined and compressed into a single submission file using the
              .zip format. Free encoders and decoders for this format running
              on many different platforms are available at the <a href=
              "http://www.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/">Info-ZIP</a> web site,
              which includes a FAQ and much other useful information about
              the .zip format. Many commercial compressor-archiver utilities
              also support this format.</p>

              <p>The submission file should contain material as if on the
              boost.org web site. The closer the submission file mirrors the
              final <a href="requirements.html#Directory_structure">directory
              structure</a> and format of the web site, the better.</p>

              <p>Like a preliminary submission, make final submission .zip
              publicly available.</p>

              <h2><a name="Review" id="Review"></a>Formal Review</h2>

              <p>Before asking for formal review, your submission should be
              easilly accessible to all. Please verify that your submission
              compiles and runs under at least two compilers. This flushes
              out obvious portability problems. If you don't have access to a
              second compiler, ask for help on the Boost mailing list.</p>

              <p>Once a library author feels a submission has matured enough
              for formal review, the author sends a message requesting a
              formal review to the mailing list. Please use a subject in the
              form "Review Request: library" where <i>library</i> is replaced
              by the library name.</p>

              <p>See <a href="/community/reviews.html">Formal Review
              Process</a> for details.</p>

              <p>Formal Review schedules are posted on the <a href=
              "/community/review_schedule.html">web site</a>.</p>

              <h2><a name="SitePosting" id="SitePosting"></a>Boost web site
              posting</h2>

              <p>Once an accepted library is ready for inclusion on the Boost
              web site, the submitter is typically given Boost repository
              write access, and expected to check-in and maintain the library
              there. Contact the moderators if you need write access or
              direct use of the repository isn't possible for you.</p>

              <h2><a name="People" id="People"></a>People page</h2>

              <p>If the boost.org web site doesn't already have your capsule
              biography and picture (optional, with not-too-serious pictures
              preferred), please send them to the Boost webmaster. It is up
              to you as to whether or not the biography includes your email
              address or other contact information. The preferred picture
              format is .jpg, but other common formats are acceptable. The
              preferred image size is 500x375 but the webmaster has photo
              editing software and can do the image preparation if
              necessary.</p>

              <h2><a name="Lifecycle" id="Lifecycle"></a>Lifecycle</h2>

              <p>Libraries are software; they lose their value over time if
              not maintained. Postings on the Boost developers or users
              mailing lists can alert you to potential maintenance needs;
              please plan to maintain your library over time. If you no
              longer can or wish to maintain your library, please post a
              message on the Boost developers mailing list and help someone
              else take over as the library maintainer.</p>
