              <h2><a name="Learn" id="Learn"></a>Learn about Boost</h2>

              <p>Subscribe to the <a href="/community/groups.html#main">main
              developers mailing list</a> for a while, or look through the
              <a href="/community/groups.html#archive">archives</a>. Click
              around the <a href="/">web site</a>. Understand the <a href=
              "requirements.html">Requirements</a>. Read the rest of this
              page to learn about the process. Otherwise, you will just end
              up wasting everyone's time.</p>

              <p>There is a culture associated with Boost, aimed at
              encouraging high quality libraries by a process of discussion
              and refinement.</p>

              <p>If what you really want is a site that will just post your
              library without even looking at it, you should go
              elsewhere.</p>

              <h2><a name="interest" id="interest"></a>Determine
              interest</h2>

              <p>While participation in prior reviews is not a prerequisite
              for submitting a library to Boost, it is highly recommended
              because it will acquaint you with the process and the emotional
              demands of a formal review.</p>

              <p>Potential library submitters should use the Boost developers
              <a href="/community/groups.html">mailing list</a> to gauge
              interest in a possible submission.</p>

              <p>A message might be as simple as "Is there any interest in a
              library which solves Travelling Salesperson problems in linear
              time?"</p>

              <p>A bit of further description or snippet of code may be
              helpful. Messages should be plain text; not rich text, HTML,
              etc.</p>

              <p>Please don't post lengthy descriptions, documentation, or
              code to the mailing list, and no attachments, even small ones.
              Please make lengthy material available on the web. You can use
              a project hosting service such as sourceforge, github, google
              code, bitbucket etc.</p>

              <h2><a name="Preliminary" id="Preliminary"></a>Preliminary
              submission</h2>

              <p>If response to an initial query indicates interest, then
              make your preliminary submission publicly available if you
              haven't already done so.</p>

              <p>Please post your code to a version control system such as
              Github, and make your documentation available in HTML format on
              a public website. An issue tracker is also highly
              recommended.</p>

              <p>The submission should contain material as if on the
              boost.org web site. The closer the submission file mirrors the
              final directory structure and format of the web site, the
              better. This makes it possible for reviewers to simply copy
              your code into the Boost distribution for testing.</p>

              <p>Please verify that your submission compiles and runs under
              at least two compilers. This flushes out obvious portability
              problems.</p>

              <p>It is recommended that you release your code under the Boost
              Software License; see the <a href=
              "requirements.html">Requirements</a> page for more
              information.</p>

              <h2><a name="Refinement" id="Refinement"></a>Refinement</h2>

              <p>Discuss, refine, resubmit. Repeat until satisfied.</p>

              <p>The exact details of this process varies a lot. Sometimes it
              is public, on the mailing list, sometimes a lot of discussion
              happens in private emails. For some libraries the process is
              over quickly, for others it goes on for months.&nbsp; It's
              often challenging, and sometimes leads off in completely
              unexpected directions.</p>

              <p>The <a href="/community/groups.html#archive">archive</a> of
              past messages is one way to see how this process worked for
              other Boost libraries.</p>

              <h2><a name="Seeking" id="Seeking"></a>Seek a Review
              Manager</h2>

              <p>In order to have a formal review, the author must find a
              capable volunteer to manage the review. This should be someone
              with knowledge of the library domain, and experience with the
              review process. See <a href="/community/reviews.html">Formal
              Review Process</a> for the responsibilities of the review
              manager.</p>

              <p>Authors can find community members interested in managing
              reviews through discussion of the library on the developer
              list. If no one steps forward to volunteer to manage the
              review, it is appropriate to contact an experienced Boost
              member who showed interest in the library. Be considerate that
              managing a review is a serious commitment; for this reason,
              it's better to contact the member off-list.</p>

              <p>Once a potential review manager has been found, contact the
              review wizards for approval. The wizards approve review
              managers based on their level of participation in the Boost
              community.</p>

              <h2><a name="Review" id="Review"></a>Formal Review</h2>

              <p>Before asking for formal review, your submission should be
              easily accessible to all. Please verify that your submission
              compiles and runs under at least two compilers. This flushes
              out obvious portability problems. If you don't have access to a
              second compiler, ask for help on the Boost mailing list.</p>

              <p>Once a library author feels a submission has matured enough
              for the formal review, and has found someone to manage the
              review, the author sends a message requesting a formal review
              to the mailing list and the review wizards. Please use a
              subject in the form "Review Request: library" where
              <i>library</i> is replaced by the library name.</p>

              <p>The review wizards will coordinate with the author and
              review manager to schedule a date convenient for the author and
              review manager.</p>

              <p>See <a href="/community/reviews.html">Formal Review
              Process</a> for details.</p>

              <p>Formal Review schedules are posted on the <a href=
              "/community/review_schedule.html">web site</a>.</p>

              <h2><a name="SitePosting" id="SitePosting"></a>Boost web site
              posting</h2>

              <p>Once an accepted library is ready for inclusion on the Boost
              web site, the submitter is typically given Boost repository
              write access, and expected to check-in and maintain the library
              there. Contact the moderators if you need write access or
              direct use of the repository isn't possible for you.</p>

              <h2><a name="People" id="People"></a>People page</h2>

              <p>If the boost.org web site doesn't already have your capsule
              biography and picture (optional, with not-too-serious pictures
              preferred), please send them to the Boost webmaster. It is up
              to you as to whether or not the biography includes your email
              address or other contact information. The preferred picture
              format is .jpg, but other common formats are acceptable. The
              preferred image size is 500x375 but the webmaster has photo
              editing software and can do the image preparation if
              necessary.</p>

              <h2><a name="Lifecycle" id="Lifecycle"></a>Lifecycle</h2>

              <p>Libraries are software; they lose their value over time if
              not maintained. Postings on the Boost developers or users
              mailing lists can alert you to potential maintenance needs;
              please plan to maintain your library over time. If you no
              longer can or wish to maintain your library, please post a
              message on the Boost developers mailing list and help someone
              else take over as the library maintainer.</p>

              <p>Orphaned libraries will be put in the care of the <a href=
              "https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/wiki/CommunityMaintenance">Community
