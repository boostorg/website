[section Supported Compilers]

New in this release is improved support for the IBM XL C/C++ compiler.

Boost is tested on a wide range of compilers and platforms. Since Boost
libraries rely on modern C++ features not available in all compilers, not all
Boost libraries will work with every compiler. New in this release The
following compilers and platforms have been extensively tested with Boost,
although many other compilers and platforms will work as well. For more
information, see the [@https://www.boost.org/regression/release/user/ regression
test results].

* [@http://developer.apple.com/ Apple GCC] 4.0.1 on Mac OS X.
* [@http://www.codegear.com/products/cppbuilder Borland C++] 5.8.2 on Windows.

  non-standard "Safe" C++ Library shipping with Visual C++ 8.0, which may
  result in many spurious warnings from Boost headers and other
  standards-conforming C++ code. To suppress these warnings, define the macro
  `_SCL_SECURE_NO_DEPRECATE`.
