[section Known Issue]

* Boost.Python will fail to build if it is complied agains a version of
  python that is one of: 3.0.X, 3.1.X, 3.2.X, 3.3.X. Versions 2.X and 3.4+
  are not affected.
  This is fixed in
  [@https://github.com/boostorg/python/commit/3e405b6fd5db5615bbef241763de070118222ca7
  git].
* Boost.Fusion has a regression with non-constexpr types. [ticket 11211]
  This is fixed in some PRs:

[section Updated Libraries]

* [phrase library..[@/libs/asio/ Asio]:]
  * Ensured errors generated by Windows' `ConnectEx` function are mapped to their
    portable equivalents ([ticket 10744]).
  * Added new macro `BOOST_ASIO_DISABLE_CONNECTEX` to allow use of `ConnectEx` to
    be explicitly disabled.
  * Fixed a race condition in `windows::object_handle` when there are pending
    wait operations on destruction ([ticket 10624]).
  * Fixed IPv6 address parsing on FreeBSD, where a trailing scope ID would cause
    conversion to fail with `EINVAL`.
  * Worked around shared library visibility issues by ensuring Asio types use
    default visibility ([ticket 9465], [ticket 11070]).
  * Changed the SSL wrapper to call the password callback when loading an
    in-memory key ([ticket 10828]).
  * Fixed false SSL error reports by ensuring that the SSL error queue is cleared
    prior to each operation.
  * Fixed an `ssl::stream<>` bug that may result in spurious 'short read' errors.
  * Removed a redundant null pointer check in the SSL engine ([ticket 10088]).
  * Added options for disabling TLS v1.1 and v1.2 ([ticket 10690]).
  * Removed use of deprecated OpenSSL function `ERR_remove_state`.
  * Fixed detection of various C++11 features with Clang ([ticket 8835],
    [ticket 10884]).
  * Fixed detection of C++11 `std::addressof` with [^g++] ([ticket 10982]).
  * Changed multicast test to treat certain `join_group` failures as non-fatal.
  * Decoupled Asio unit tests from Boost.Test ([ticket 11116]).
  * Changed the tutorial to use `std::endl` to ensure output is flushed.
  * Fixed an unsigned integer overflow reported by Clang's integer sanitizer.
  * Added support for move-only return types when using a `yield_context` object
    with asynchronous operations.
  * Changed `yield_context` to allow reentrant calls to the completion handler
    from an initiating function.
  * Updated detection of Windows Runtime to work with latest Windows SDK.

* [phrase library..[@/libs/chrono/ Chrono]:]
  * ['Version] 2.0.5
  * ['Fixes:]
    * [@http://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/10778 #10778]	VC14 CTP4 Atomic don't compile with boost::chrono durations which are not TriviallyCopyable
    * [@http://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/10840 #10840] 	Missing std:: qualifier for puts call in test_7868.cpp

    * [@http://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/11012 #11012] 	chrono_io v2 fail to compile with boost::chrono::duration< boost::rational<int> >

* [phrase library..[@/libs/container/ Container]:]
  * Experimental `small_vector` container.
  * Massive dependency reorganization. Now ['Boost.Container] depends on very basic utilities like Boost.Core
    and ['Boost.Intrusive]. Preprocessed code size have decreased considerably and compilation times have improved.
  * Added `nth` and `index_of` functions to containers with random-access iterators (except `basic_string`).
  * Added C++17's `allocator_traits<Allocator>::is_always_equal`.
  * Updated containers to implement new constructors as specified in
    [@http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/lwg-defects.html#2210 2210. Missing allocator-extended constructor for allocator-aware containers].
  * Fixed bugs:
    * [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/9931 #9931: ['"flat_map::insert(ordered_unique_range_t...) fails with move_iterators"]] (reopened).
    * [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/11076 #11076: ['"Unqualified calls to memmove/memcpy in container/detail/copy_move_algo.hpp"]].
    * [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/10790 Trac #10790 (['long long errors from container"])].
    * [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/10808 Trac #10808 (['compare equal operator of vector is broken"])].
  * ['Source Breaking]: `scoped_allocator_adaptor`'s
    `propagate_on_container_copy_assignment`, `propagate_on_container_move_assignment` and `propagate_on_container_swap`
    are no longer `::boost::integral_constant<bool, true/false>` types. The dependency reorganization needed to break
    with those classes to avoid MPL dependencies, and interoperability with `std::integral_constant` was not guaranteed.
    Code assumming `boost::true_type/boost::false_type` on this will not compile. As a workaround, use the guaranteed internal
    `::value` constant: `::boost::integral_constant<bool, scoped_allocator_adaptor<Allocator>::propagate_on_container_move_assignment::value>`.

* [phrase library..[@/libs/context/ Context]:]
  * support for ARM/iOS (32+64 bit)
  * class execution_context (C++14)

* [phrase library..[@/libs/conversion/ Conversion]:]
  * `polymorphic_pointer_downcast` and `polymorphic_pointer_cast` functions were added (thanks to Boris Rasin) [ticket 10780]
  * All the functions now throw exceptions using `boost::throw_exception`
  * Documnetation update

* [phrase library..[@/libs/date_time/ DateTime]:]
  * Restored `to_time_t` function.
  * Renamed variable v_type to var_type so it longer conflicts with an AIX
    system variable.
  * Documnetation fixes.

* [phrase library..[@/libs/flyweight/ Flyweight]:]
  * Added hash support both with `std::hash` and [@/doc/html/hash.html `boost::hash`]. This can be
    optionally [@/libs/flyweight/doc/reference/flyweight.html#disable_hash_support disabled] to avoid
    clashes with legacy code where this support has already been defined by the user.
  * Maintenance fixes.

* [phrase library..[@/libs/function/ Function]:]
  * Added support for functions accepting C++11 rvalues and Boost.Move rvalues [ticket 10585].

* [phrase library..[@/libs/functional/factory/ Functional/Factory]:]
  * Minor breaking change: the default template parameter to indicate that it
    shouldn't use an allocator is now `void`, instead of `boost::none_t`.
    For details, see the
    [@/libs/functional/factory/doc/html/#boost_functional_factory.changes changelog].

* [phrase library..[@/libs/fusion/ Fusion]:]
  * Automatic hash creation function ([@https://github.com/boostorg/fusion/pull/12 Github PR #12])
  * New ADAPT_STRUCT, ADAPT_ADT, ADAPT_ASSOC_ that deduce the members types ([ticket 9516]).
  * Add convert implementation for Boost.Tuple and std::tuple.
  * Add mpl::clear implementation for Boost.Tuple and std::tuple.
  * Use boost::declval instead of std::declval, ([ticket 10190]).
  * Remove use of `boost::blank` ([ticket 8622]).
  * Add result_of::{copy,move} ([ticket 5886]).
  * Better constexpr and noexcept support.
  * Improved SFINAE Friendliness of many metafunctions ([ticket 10676], [ticket 10443]). 
  * result_of::size::value and result_of::size::type::value are the same type now ([ticket 7304])
  * result_of::at<Seq, N>::type is now defined when sizeof of sequence is less than N ([ticket 6507], [ticket 7651]) 
  * Fix missing includes ([ticket 8457]).
  * Many documentation fixes & improvements ([ticket 6090], [ticket 5324], [@https://github.com/boostorg/fusion/pull/33 GitHub PR #33], [@https://github.com/boostorg/fusion/pull/53 GitHub PR #53], [@https://github.com/boostorg/fusion/pull/56 GitHub PR #56])

* [phrase library..[@/libs/geometry/ Geometry]:]
  * ['Additional functionality:]
    * New algorithm num_segments, returning the number of segments of a geometry
    * New overload for is_valid algorithm, that takes a string reference as a second argument and fills it with a message related to the validity or invalidity of the geometry
    * New overload for is_valid algorithm, that takes an enum reference as a second argument and fills it with a value related to the validity or invalidity of the geometry
    * Disjoint and intersects support the following geometry combinations: point/multipoint, multipoint/multipoint, multipoint/segment, multipoint/box
  * ['Improvements:]
    * Buffer now supports flat-ends for linestrings with a bend close to the start (such that buffered segment crosses flat-end).
    * Buffer performance is improved significantly
    * Partition performance is improved significantly for polygons, potentially enhancing all overlay operations

    * Bug in multipoint/polygon multipoint/multipolygon distance computation (wrong detection of points inside the areal geometry)
    * Bug in flatten_iterator's assignment operator causing an access violation 
    * Bug in Cartesian segment-segment intersection strategy when one segment degenerates to a point and is collinear to the other non-degenerate segment

    * Bug in buffers for joins with large buffer distances
    * Bug in buffers for round ends with an odd number of points
    * Bug in buffers for flat ends with large buffer distances
    * Bug in buffers for interior rings with large negative buffer distances
    * Bug in closing_iterator not working properly when the input range is empty
    * Bug in is_simple, not handling properly closed simple linestrings within multilinestrings
    * Bug in rtree constructors taking a pair of Iterators or a Range (packing algorithm), the use of reference to destroyed temporary when Iterator's reference is not true reference, e.g. for some of the Range Adaptors. It also affects distance() and comparable_distance(). This bug may cause unexpected behavior of the rtree or distance() algorithm, e.g. an assertion failure or a SEGFAULT.
    * Bug in rtree count() member function, the use of reference to destroyed temporary when object of type convertible but not the same as value_type or indexable_type is passed. If this happens, wrong result may be returned, in most cases 0.
    * Bugs related to the handling of Ranges, preventing compilation of Geometries using non-Container Ranges in some algorithms (thanks to Samuel Debionne)

* [phrase library..[@/libs/hash/ Hash]:]
  * Fixed strict aliasing violation
    ([@https://github.com/boostorg/functional/pull/3 GitHub #3]).

* [phrase library..[@/libs/interprocess/ Interprocess]:]
  * Reduced some compile-time dependencies. Updated to Boost.Container changes.
  * Fixed bugs:
     * [@https://github.com/boostorg/interprocess/pull/13 GitHub Pull #13 (['"haiku: we don't have XSI shared memory, so don't try to use it"])].

* [phrase library..[@/libs/intrusive/ Intrusive]:]
  * Reduced compile-time dependencies, headers, and the use of Boost.Preprocessor, specially for hooks and iterators.
  * Fixed bugs:
     * [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/6720  Boost Trac #6720: ['intrusive::unordered_set::clear_and_dispose does not compile on VC11 Beta when passed a stateless lambda]]
     * [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/10771 Boost Trac #10771: ['remove_if is broken for slist]]

     * [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/10987 Boost Trac #10987: ['bug in any_xxx_node_traits, returning by reference]]

* [phrase library..[@/libs/lexical_cast/ Lexical Cast]:]
  * Now std::stream is used for conversions to float numbers [ticket 5660], [ticket 6975], [ticket 10639]

* [phrase library..[@/libs/log/ Log]:]
  * Bug fixes:
    * Fixed thread id formatting.
    * Fixed process id formatting. ([ticket 10926])
    * Fixed build failure on GNU Hurd.
    * Fixed incorrect behavior of text file sink backend in case if free space on the file system gets exhausted. The sink will no longer create lots of empty files in attempt to recover. ([ticket 11016])
    * Fixed incorrect behavior of `attribute_set::insert()` in some cases. The inserted elements could have made some previously inserted elements not findable. ([ticket 11106])
    * Fixed incorrect behavior of `attribute_value_set::size()` if a large number of attribute values are inserted into the set. ([ticket 11148])
  * See [@/libs/log/doc/html/log/changelog.html changelog] for more details.
  
* [phrase library..[@/libs/math/ Math]:]
  * Added two new special functions - trigamma and polygamma.
  * Large update to the Elliptic integral code to use Carlson's latest algorithms - these should be more stable, more accurate
    and slightly faster than before.  Also added support for Carlson's RG integral.
  * Added ellint_d, jacobi_zeta and heuman_lambda elliptic integrals.
  * Fixed namespace scope constants so they are constexpr on conforming compilers, see [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/10901 #10901].
  * Fixed various cases of spurious under/overflow in the incomplete beta and gamma functions, plus the elliptic integrals, with thanks to Rocco Romeo.
  * Fix 3-arg legendre_p and legendre_q functions to not call the policy based overload if the final argument is not actually a policy.
  * Cleaned up some dead code in the incomplete beta function, see [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/10985 #10985].
  * Fixed extreme-value pdf for large valued inputs, see [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/10938 #10938].
  * Switched documentation to use SVG rather than PNG graphs and equations - browsers seem to have finally caught up!

* [phrase library..[@/libs/move/ Move]:]
  * Added `BOOST_MOVE_BASE` utility.
  * Added `adl_move_swap` utility.
  * Reduced dependencies on other Boost libraries to make the library a bit more lightweight.
  * Fixed bugs:
     * [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/11044 Trac #11044: ['"boost::rv inherits off union, when such passed as template argument"]].

* [phrase library..[@/libs/multi_index/index.html Multi-index Containers]:]
  * The efficiency of lookup operations has improved in situations where they involve the generation
    of temporary values of `key_type`. Consider for instance the following code: 
    ```
    typedef multi_index_container<
      std::string,
      indexed_by<
        ordered_unique<identity<std::string> >
      >
    > multi_t;
    ...
    multi_t m=...;
    m.find("boost"); // passed a const char*, not a std::string    
    ```
    In previous versions of the library, the `find` operation generates several temporary
    `std::string`s (one every time an internal comparison is made). In sufficiently advanced
    compilers, this is now avoided so that only one temporary is created.
  * Maintenance fixes.

* [phrase library..[@/libs/multiprecision/ Multiprecision]:]
  * Changed `frexp` to always be non-expression template generating, see: [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/10993 10993].
  * Improved support of cpp_dec_float on Cygwin and other platforms with missing long double support, see [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/10924 10924].
  * Improved noexcept support and added some more tests, see [@https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/10990 10990].
  * Various workarounds applied for Intel-15.0 and Solaris-12.4 compilers.

* [phrase library..[@/libs/optional/ Optional]:]
  * Improved documentation; documented IO operations and header files.
  * ['Fixed Bugs:]
    * `boost::none_t` is no longer convertible from literal 0. This avoids a bug where `optional<rational<int>> oi = 0;` would initialize an optional object with no contained value. 
    * Added a way to manually disable move semantics: just define macro `BOOST_OPTIONAL_CONFIG_NO_RVALUE_REFERENCES`. This can be used to work around [@http://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/10399 #10399].
    * [@http://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/10825 #10825] Improved the trick that prevents streaming out `optional` without header `optional_io.hpp` by using safe-bool idiom.
    * [@http://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/11087 #11087] It is no longer possible to assign `optional<U>` to `optional<T>` when `U` is not assignable or convertible to `T`.
    * [@http://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/10839 #10839] Value accessors now work correctly on rvalues of `optional<T&>`.

* [phrase library..[@/libs/phoenix/ Phoenix]:]
  * Version 3.2.0
  * ['New Features:]
    * Phoenix now has a /lazy list/ implementation as an optional extension.
  * ['New Example:]
    * A new example /bind_goose/ shows the compatibility between /boost bind/ and /boost phoenix bind/.
  * ['Fixed Bugs:]
    * [@http://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/10927 #10927] Missing `std::` qualifier for `fabs` in `phoenix/test/stdlib/cmath.cpp`
    * [@http://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/11085 #11085] Missing qualifier for pow call in `phoenix/test/function/function_tests.cpp`
    * Fixes for a number of cases failing with /bind/, /lambda/ and /let/.

* [phrase library..[@/libs/predef/ Predef]:]
  * Version 1.2
  * Added Visual Studio 2015 detection.
  * Added detection of Haiku OS.
  * Fix Android endian detection.
  * Added `predef_check` program and BBv2 integration for build configuration checks.

* [phrase library..[@/libs/random/ Random]:]
  * Added non_central_chi_squared_distribution.

* [phrase library..[@/libs/thread/ Thread]:]
  * ['Version] 4.5.0
  * ['New Experimental Features:]
    * [@http://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/9600 #9600] Async: Add task_region
    * [@http://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/10611 #10611] Add emplace promise::set_value and emplace make_ready_future

    * [@http://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/10979 #10979] Support T& type deduction when the make_ready_future parameter is reference_wrapper<T>
    * [@http://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/10996 #10996] Thread physical_concurrency() is failing on Windows
    * [@http://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/11035 #11035] BOOST_HAS_PTHREAD_MUTEXATTR_SETTYPE not defined for Android
    * [@http://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/11053 #11053] The attached code results in a R6025 - pure virtual function call in run_thread_exit_callbacks

* [phrase library..[@/libs/type_erasure/ TypeErasure]:]
  * Fixed compilation with MSVC 12.

* [phrase library..[@/libs/type_index/ TypeIndex]:]
  * Link time assertions added on platforms that support it

* [phrase library..[@/libs/units Units]:]
  * Fix for base units with arbitrary dimensions.

* [phrase library..[@/libs/unordered Unordered]:]
  * Fix move assignment with stateful, propagate_on_container_move_assign
    allocators ([ticket 10777]).
  * Fix potential overflow when calculating number of buckets to allocate
    ([@https://github.com/boostorg/unordered/pull/4 GitHub #4]).
  * Other minor changes, see [@/doc/html/unordered/changes.html changelog].

* [phrase library..[@/libs/variant/ Variant]:]
  * [*Breaking change:] Compile time checked getter is now used by default in `boost::get<U>(VariantT)` and `boost::polymorphic_get<U>(VariantT)`.
    New getter asserts that type `U` is one of the types that can be stored in `VariantT`. Define `BOOST_VARIANT_USE_RELAXED_GET_BY_DEFAULT`
    to change default behavior. See
    [@/doc/html/variant/reference.html#header.boost.variant.get_hpp get.hpp] and
    [@/doc/html/variant/reference.html#header.boost.variant.polymorphic_get_hpp polymorphic_get.hpp]
    descriptions for more info [ticket 547].
  * Added missing comparison operators to variant [ticket 8620], [ticket 10811]
  * Multiple documentations fixes [ticket 10273], [ticket 10653]
  * Variadic templats enabled on Clang [ticket 10832]
  * Autodetection of return types for visitors in C++14, which makes it possible to use `boost::apply_visitor` with generic lambdas [ticket 10837]:
    ```
    auto str = boost::apply_visitor(
        [](auto v) {
            return boost::lexical_cast<std::string>(v);
        },
        variant_instance
    );
    ```
  * Improved swap functions [ticket 10882]
  * Many improvements to variadic templates, even more methods support variadics.
  * Multiple bugfixes and testing improvements including Coveralls integration
