[section Updated Libraries]

[/ Example:
* [phrase library..[@/libs/interprocess/ Interprocess]:]
  * Added anonymous shared memory for UNIX systems.
  * `shared_ptr` is movable and supports aliasing ([ticket 1234]).
]

* [phrase library..[@/libs/chrono/ Chrono]:]
  * [@http://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/11330 #11330] boost::chrono::duration default constructor doesn't initialize rep_
  * [@http://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/11618 #11618] Chrono IO V2 doc ios_state.hpp does not exist
  * [@http://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/11631 #11631] boost chrono io v2 does not let you support custom clocks  

* [phrase library..[@/libs/circular_buffer/ Circular Buffer]:]
  * Debug implementation is no longer used by default in debug mode. Debug implementation does not have the same thread safety guarantees as the normal (release) implementation or other containers. As a result of this change `BOOST_CB_DISABLE_DEBUG` macro is no longer used. `BOOST_CB_ENABLE_DEBUG=1` should be defined instead to enable debug support. ([ticket 6277])

* [phrase library..[@/libs/context/ Context]:]
  * [ticket 12215] all stack corrupted on Windows using default fixedsize_stack
  * [ticket 12242] build issue with Intel C++ compiler for MacOS
  * fix stack unwinding for execution_context_v1

* [phrase library..[@/libs/coroutine2/ Coroutine2]:]
  * [ticket 12221] coroutine<>::push_type function starts without pushing
  * do not swallow exceptions thrown at coroutine<>::push_type construction

* [phrase library..[@/libs/functional/forward/ Functional/Forward]:]
  * Fix C++11 compile error.

* [phrase library..[@/libs/log/ Log]:]
  * New features:
    * Added new tools for inter-process logging on a local machine. The implementation includes a resource name wrapper, an inter-process message queue and a sink backend.
    * Added a new character decorator called `max_size_decor`. The new decorator allows to limit the output of its adopted formatter up to the specified length.
  * Bug fixes:
    * Fixed that logging streams could retain formatting settings across different log records. ([ticket 12178])
  * See [@/libs/log/doc/html/log/changelog.html changelog] for more details.

* [phrase library..[@/libs/phoenix/ Phoenix]:]
  * Fix compilation for MSVC 10. [@https://github.com/boostorg/phoenix/pull/18 pull-request 18]
  * Remove unused preprocessed files. [@https://github.com/boostorg/phoenix/pull/28 pull-request 28]
  * Fix erroneous doc for switch_ statement. [ticket 8156]
  * Cleanup config unordered. [@https://github.com/boostorg/phoenix/pull/33 pull-request 33]
  * Suppress unused placeholder warnings.
  * Fix too few arguments error on binary math functions.

* [phrase library..[@/libs/thread/ Thread]:]
  * [@http://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/12102 #12102] condition_variable_fwd.hpp fails to compile when BOOST_THREAD_PROVIDES_INTERRUPTIONS is disabled
  * [@http://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/12120 #12120] Performance improvement in thread/barrier.hpp
  * [@http://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/12146 #12146] make_exceptional_future is not mentioned in the docs

   individual release notes. So check if they apply before the beta:
