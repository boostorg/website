[section Notes for non-Windows users]

The Boost build system now supports visibilities. If you are building shared
libraries, they will use hidden visibility by default. As a result Boost shared
libraries become smaller, load faster and have less chances to get a symbol
collision.

See [@/build/manual/develop/index.html#bbv2.builtin.features.visibility Boost.Build visibility and local-visibility] for more info.

To disable that feature you can use use a command line `./b2 visibility=global`
to build.

    * Missing visibility mark on exception types ([github spirit 409])

* [phrase library..[@/libs/stacktrace/ Stacktrace]:]
  * `libbacktrace` usage was significantly improved. `BOOST_STACKTRACE_USE_BACKTRACE` or `boost_stacktrace_backtrace` users are encouraged to update:
    * Memory consumprion dropped down.

    change, but its impact is expected to be limited.

  * The constructors of `error_category` are now `protected`.
  * A non-allocating, nonthrowing overload of `message` has been added.
  * A virtual function `failed` has been added, allowing categories for which success is not synonymous with 0.
  * The deprecated `boost::system::throws` object has been removed.
  * `boost::throws()` is now deprecated and its use is discouraged.
  * The constructor of `system_error` taking a single `error_code` argument is now `explicit`.
  * `system_error::code()` now returns by value.

* [phrase library..[@/libs/test/ Test]:]
  * Boost.test v3.9 see the
    [@libs/test/doc/html/boost_test/change_log.html Changes log]
    for more details.
  * New feature:
    * Official support of header-only variant of Boost.Test with multiple translation units.
    * Now possible to manually add a test case by specifying its name, with `BOOST_TEST_CASE_NAME`
    * Better support of `boost::exception` in the logs
  * Bug fixes and pull requests:
    * Trac tickets: [ticket 13380], [ticket 13625], [ticket 13637]
    * GitHub Issues: [github test 149], [github test 150], [github test 156], [github test 158], [github test 163]
    * GitHub Pull Requests: [github_pr test 147], [github_pr test 148], [github_pr test 151], [github_pr test 154], [github_pr test 161]

* [phrase library..[@/libs/type_index/ TypeIndex]:]
  * Fix the regression and speed up parsing of the `boost/type_traits.hpp` header by 30% (thanks to Nikita Kniazev for the PR!) [github type_index 21].

* [phrase library..[@/libs/utility/ Utility]:]
  * Added support for non-inheritable empty types to `boost::compressed_pair`
    by avoiding the empty base optimization for types which are declared as
    final (Glen Fernandes).

* [phrase library..[@/libs/variant/ Variant]:]
  * Fixed issue with visibility. Now `boost::bad_visit` exception could cross the boundaries of shared library with hidden visibility and could be catched in other shared library with hidden visibility.

* [phrase library..[@/libs/yap/ YAP]:]
  * Minor changes to support MSVC++ version 14.15 (Visual Studio 2017 version 15.8).
  * Doc fixes.

[section Discontinued Libraries]

* Signals (v1) is now removed. Its removal was announced in 1.68 and its
deprecation was announced in 1.54. Boost 1.68 is the last release that provides
this library. Users are encouraged to use Signals2 instead. The Boost community
thanks Douglas Gregor for his work on Signals which served its users well and
which also inspired Signals2.
