[section Updated Libraries]

[/ Example:
* [phrase library..[@/libs/interprocess/ Interprocess]:]
  * Added anonymous shared memory for UNIX systems.
  * Move semantics for shared objects ([ticket 1932]).
  * Conform to `std::pointer_traits` requirements ([github_pr interprocess 32])
  * Fixed `named_condition_any` fails to notify ([github interprocess 62])
]

* [phrase library..[@/libs/flyweight/index.html Flyweight]:]
  * Added [@/libs/flyweight/doc/tutorial/configuration.html#concurrent_factory `concurrent_factory`],
    a factory based on a concurrent container from [@/libs/unordered/ Boost.Unordered]
    that provides excellent performance in multithreaded scenarios.
  * Marked as `noexcept` those `boost::flyweight` operations previously documented
    as not throwing (issue [github flyweight 15]).

* [phrase library..[@/libs/unordered/ Unordered]:]
  * [*Major update.]
  * Added concurrent, node-based containers `boost::concurrent_node_map` and
    `boost::concurrent_node_set`.
  * Added `insert_and_visit(x, f1, f2)` and similar operations to concurrent containers,
    which allow for visitation of an element right after insertion (by contrast,
    `insert_or_visit(x, f)` only visits the element if insertion did _not_ take place).
  * Made visitation exclusive-locked within certain `boost::concurrent_flat_set`
    operations to allow for safe mutable modification of elements ([github_pr unordered 265]).
  * In Visual Studio Natvis, supported any container with an allocator that uses fancy
    pointers. This applies to any fancy pointer type, as long as the proper Natvis
    customization point "Intrinsic" functions are written for the fancy pointer type.
  * Added GDB pretty-printers for all containers and iterators. For a container with an
    allocator that uses fancy pointers, these only work if the proper pretty-printer is
    written for the fancy pointer type itself.
  * Fixed `std::initializer_list` assignment issues for open-addressing containers
    ([github_pr unordered 277]).
  * Allowed non-copyable callables to be passed to the `std::initializer_list` overloads of
    `insert_{and|or}_[c]visit` for concurrent containers, by internally passing a
    `std::reference_wrapper` of the callable to the iterator-pair overloads.
