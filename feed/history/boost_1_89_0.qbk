[section Updated Libraries]

[/ Example:
* [phrase library..[@/libs/interprocess/ Interprocess]:]
  * Added anonymous shared memory for UNIX systems.
  * Move semantics for shared objects ([ticket 1932]).
  * Conform to `std::pointer_traits` requirements ([github_pr interprocess 32])
  * Fixed `named_condition_any` fails to notify ([github interprocess 62])
]

 * [phrase library..[@/libs/any/ Any]:]
   * [*Initial support for C++20 Modules]. See the docs for more info.

* [phrase library..[@/libs/beast/ Beast]:]
  * Fixes
    * Conditionally defined `immediate_executor_type` in `async_base`.
    * Added missing `cstdint` header to `detail/cpu_info.hpp`.
    * Fixed `std::is_trivial` deprecation warnings.
    * `handshake_timeout` now applies to closing handshakes during reads.
  * Improvements
    * Replaced `detail/work_guard.hpp` with `net::executor_work_guard`.
    * Fixed portability issues for building tests in MinGW.
  * Documentation
    * Removed moved sections from documentation.
    * Removed superfluous log messages from tests.
  * Acknowledgements
    * yliu1021

* [phrase library..[@/libs/compat/ Compat]:]
  * Added `move_only_function.hpp`.

* [phrase library..[@/libs/container_hash/ ContainerHash]:]
  * Added the `hash_is_avalanching` trait class.

* [phrase library..[@/libs/conversion/ Conversion]:]
   * Added an ability to use `polymorphic_downcast` and `polymorphic_cast` in constexpr (requires C++20).

* [phrase library..[@/libs/dll/ DLL]:]
   * Fixed compiling and exporting on Cygwin. Many thanks to [@https://github.com/Luohaothu Luohao Wang]
     for the PR!
   * Fixed building on FreeBSD. Thanks to [@https://github.com/agokhale ash] for the bug report!
   * Added `BOOST_DLL_USE_STD_FS` CMake option to match the preprocessor option. Thanks to
     [@https://github.com/yurybura Yury Bura] for the PR!

* [phrase library..[@/libs/hash2/ Hash2]:]
  * Added Blake2 algorithm (`blake2s_256`, `blake2b_512`).
  * Added XXH3 algorithm (`xxh3_128`).

* [phrase library..[@/libs/json/ JSON]:]
  * Revamped documentation.
  * Optionals that are ranges are categorised as optionals.
  * Described class support is enabled for types with bases.

* [phrase library..[@/libs/mysql/ MySQL]:]
  * The `caching_sha2_password` authentication plugin can now be used without TLS.
    This is the default in MySQL 8 and above. Plaintext connections that attempt to
    use this plugin no longer fail with `client_errc::auth_plugin_requires_ssl`
    ([github mysql 313]).
  * Fixed a problem causing `client_errc::incomplete_message` to be returned
    during connection establishment when the target database does not exist
    and the `caching_sha2_password` is used. The appropriate server-generated
    diagnostic is now returned. See issues [github mysql 468] and [github mysql 488].
  * The handshake algorithm is now more resilient to protocol violations
    ([github mysql 469]).
  * Fixed a build failure with gcc-15 due to a missing include ([github_pr mysql 475]).
    Thanks [@https://github.com/hhoffstaette hhoffstaette] for the PR.
  * Added [@https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/master/libs/mysql/doc/html/mysql/benchmarks.html benchmarks against the official drivers].
  * Optimized `metadata` representation to be faster to construct and take less memory
    ([github mysql 461]).
  
* [phrase library..[@/libs/pfr/ PFR]:]
   * Rewrite C++20 module following the new recommended Boost practice. See the docs for more info.
   * Fixed C++26 compilation on modern clang compilers. Thanks to
     [@https://github.com/MBkkt Valery Mironov] for the report!
   * Support types that use 'Arrays of Length Zero' compiler extension.
   * Fixed typos. Thanks to [@https://github.com/TryKuhn Egor] for highlighting the issues!
   * Return `std::array<std::string_view, 0>` type for `boost::pfr::names_as_array(empty_struct{})`
     to allow compilation of `for (std::string_view name : boost::pfr::names_as_array(empty_struct{}))`.
     Many thanks to [@https://github.com/sabudilovskiy sabudilovskiy] for the bug report!

* [phrase library..[@/libs/type_index/ TypeIndex]:]
   * [*Initial support for C++20 Modules]. See the docs for more info.

* [phrase library..[@/libs/unordered/ Unordered]:]
  * Deprecated `boost::unordered::hash_is_avalanching` is now a using-declaration of
    `boost::hash_is_avalanching` in `<boost/container_hash/hash_is_avalanching.hpp>`.
    Use that header directly instead. `<boost/unordered/hash_traits.hpp>` will be
    removed in the future.
  * Added `pull(const_iterator)` to open-addressing containers. This operation allows for
    efficient removal and retrieval of an element via move construction.

* [phrase library..[@/libs/histogram/ Histogram]:]
  * Update CMake minimum version and Python detection in CMake
  * Improve documentation
    * Add example on how to make an axis which accepts multiple value types that are not implicitly convertible
    * Show how to use `histogram::fill` with a multidimensional histogram efficiently when data per dimension is already available as contiguous data
  * Don't use deprecated form of user-defined literal operator
  * Add support for modular build structure with b2
  * Fixed warnings in MSVC about narrowed types
  * Added collector accumulator, which stores all values in a bin
  * Internal changes to tests and classes in detail namespace
