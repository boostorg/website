                  <h2>Welcome to Boost.org!</h2>

                  <p>Boost provides free peer-reviewed portable C++ source
                  libraries.</p>

                  <p>We emphasize libraries that work well with the C++
                  Standard Library. Boost libraries are intended to be widely
                  useful, and usable across a broad spectrum of applications.
                  The <a href="/users/license.html">Boost license</a>
                  encourages the use of Boost libraries for all users with
                  minimal restrictions.</p>

                  <p>We aim to establish "existing practice" and provide
                  reference implementations so that Boost libraries are
                  suitable for eventual standardization. Beginning with the
                  ten Boost Libraries included in the Library Technical
                  Report (<a href=
                  "http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2005/n1745.pdf"
                  class="external">TR1</a>) and continuing with every release
                  of the ISO standard for C++ since 2011, the <a href=
                  "http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/" class=
                  "external">C++ Standards Committee</a> has continued to
                  rely on Boost as a valuable source for additions to the
                  Standard C++ Library.</p>

                  <h2>Boost as an organization</h2>

                  <p>The Boost organization and wider Boost community
                  supports research and education into the best possible uses
                  of C++ and libraries developed for it, particularly, but
                  not exclusively those contained in the Boost Library.</p>

                  <p>The organization and community support mailing lists and
                  chat rooms to educate about best practices and cutting edge
                  techniques for the user of Boost Libraries and C++ in
                  general.</p>

                  <p>Since 2006 an intimate week long annual conference
                  related to Boost called <a href="http://cppnow.org/" class=
                  "external">C++ Now</a> has been held in Aspen, Colorado
                  each May. The conference is an educational opportunity
                  focused on cutting-edge C++. Boost has been a participant
                  in the annual Google Summer of Code since 2007, in which
                  students develop their skills by working on Boost Library
                  development.</p>

                  <h3 class="note">Getting Started</h3>

                  <p class="note"><span class="note-body">Boost works on
                  almost any modern operating system, including UNIX and
                  Windows variants. Follow the <a href=
                  "/doc/libs/release/more/getting_started/index.html">Getting
                  Started Guide</a> to download and install Boost. Popular
                  Linux and Unix distributions such as <a href=

                  class="external">NetBSD</a> include pre-built Boost
                  packages. Boost may also already be available on your
                  organization's internal web server.</span></p>
