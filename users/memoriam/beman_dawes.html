              <a href="https://www.boost.org/users/people/beman_dawes.html">Beman
              Dawes</a> passed on December first, 2020 at the age of 81 years.
              He was survived by his wife Sonda.

              <p><strong>Dave Abrahams:</strong> Beman Dawes was my friend,
              inspiration, and collaborator.  He was a living demonstration
              that collegial respect and kindness are fundamental to getting
              great results. His idea for Boost blossomed into a unique
              community, inventing the art of library design. RIP.</p>

              <p><strong>Emil Dotchevski:</strong> I talked with Beman many
              times. He was always kind, and through my experience with him I
              am honored to have had a chance to work with this brilliant
              member of our community. He should be celebrated as one of those
              little-known figures who nonetheless has had an enormous positive
              impact on the world through his work.</p>

              <p><strong>Stefanus Du Toit:</strong> Just learned about the
              passing of Beman Dawes. Beman was a truly positive and
              inspirational influence on the C++ community. A rare example of
              someone putting contribution to the greater good above all else.
              You'll be missed, Beman.</p>

              <p><strong>Howard Hinnant:</strong> He was a friend. He was a
              giant. He will be missed.</p>

              <p><strong>Jon Kalb:</strong> Beman Dawes' legacy in the C++
              community is matched by few. As a leader in the process of
              defining the C++ standard, he recognized a need for high quality,
              non-proprietary libraries. He saw not only that these were few,
              but that there was no environment to create new ones. He created
              the Boost Libraries with the goal of making high quality,
              peer-reviewed, open source libraries available for every C++
              programmer and as an environment to develop candidate libraries
              for standardization. He then helped launch BoostCon (now C++Now),
              as a way of nurturing the community that made Boost possible and
              appreciates high quality C++ libraries. He did all of this with
              such humor, humility, generosity, and grace that he will be much
              missed.</p>

              <p><strong>Robert Ramey:</strong> I do not think C++ would be
              where it is today without the extraordinary accomplishments of
              two particular people.  Beman Dawes and David Abrahams. Before
              their efforts in the late nineties C++ was suffering from a lack
              of libraries which made it noncompetitive with alternatives being
              promoted at the time - most notably Java and C#. These
              alternatives were funded by they biggest of the big. The future
              must have looked bleak to C++ fans at the time. I was looking for
              an alternative to C++ when I came upon Boost with a number of
              portable and indispensable libraries. Boost was founded by these
              two gentleman (of complimentary personalities). That changed
              everything for me - and I'm sure I'm not the only one. And I
              suspect that it was responsible for changing the future of C++.
              To those who believe that one man can't make a big difference - I
              offer this counter example.</p>

              <p><strong>Herb Sutter:</strong> Beman was one of the most
              important and influential C++ experts in the world, and made his
              many contributions mostly behind the scenes, so that many C++
              developers have likely never heard of him. I and everyone else
              who have ever benefited from any of the standardized STL, Boost,
              C++Now, std::filesystem, C++98/11/14/17, and more - so, really,
              most people who have ever used C++ - all owe Beman a debt of
              gratitude. We miss him greatly.</p>
