              Aleksey Gurtovoy is a Russian guy from Siberia, who now lives
              and works in the United States. He is a technical lead at
              <a href="http://www.meta-comm.com" class=
              "external">MetaCommunications</a>, a job and people which have
              taught him so much.</p>

              <p>He was born in early 1977, has been in love with computers
              since 1989, and still has a lot of exciting ideas for his
              "spare time" in the next few years. He graduated with honors
              from Krasnoyarsk Technical State University in 1998 with a
              Master Degree in Computer Science.</p>

              <p>While being acknowledged as a talented programmer, Aleksey
              tries to be a better engineer than he is now and hopes that
              reading good books will help him with that task. He reads a
              lot. One of his favorite books about his profession is 'The
              Mythical Man-Month' by Frederic P. Brooks, Jr.</p>

              <p>Aleksey has been working with C++ since 1993, he loves the
              language, and is involved in its progress. Sometimes you can
              come across his articles in the <a href=
              "news:comp.lang.c++.moderated" class=
              "external">comp.lang.c++.moderated</a> and <a href=
              "news:comp.std.c++" class="external">comp.std.c++</a>
              newsgroups. The other numerous things Aleksey is interested in
              include patterns, programming languages, organization of
              software development process, and tools &amp; technologies
              which make programmer's life easier (e.g. compilers).</p>

              <p>He is not married, but he has in mind one great girl he
              hopes to be with someday.</p>
