              <p><img src="darin_adler.jpg" alt="-" class="portrait" /> Darin
              Adler has been programming computers since 1976. He loves to do
              it.</p>

              <p>His first major professional experience was at <a href=
              "http://apple.com" class="external">Apple Computer</a>. In 1988
              he led the team that rewrote the Macintosh Finder in C++.
              Before that project was completed, he was shanghaied to be the
              technical lead for the System 7 project (these days they would
              call it "Mac OS 7"). The group he formed to help him do that,
              the Blue Meanies, is still a <a href=
              "http://www.cupertino.de/pages/archiv/EasterEggs/BlueMeanies.html"
                 class="external">legend</a> in the Apple community.</p>

              <p>Since Apple, Darin has worked at <a href=
              "http://www.generalmagic.com" class="external">General
              Magic</a> as an architect of the <a href=
              "http://www.google.com/search?q=Magic+Cap" class=
              "external">Magic Cap</a> OS, used the moniker <a href=
              "http://bentspoon.com" class="external">Bent Spoon Software</a>
              to do consulting, and helped start Eazel, a company that worked
              to make Linux easier to use and developed the Nautilus
              graphical shell for <a href="http://www.gnome.org" class=
              "external">GNOME</a>. Since 1997, he has worked from his home
              in Los Angeles, CA, collaborating with clients and coworkers in
              other locations.</p>

              <p>He prefers to use and program Macintosh computers with C++.
              But work on the GNOME project is best accomplished with a
              non-Macintosh PC. (That's why Darin is sitting in front of two
              computers.) The other people working on the GNOME project don't
              like C++, so he's writing a lot of C code these days.</p>

              <p>The picture shows him hard at work with his C++ guru, his
              daughter Sophia.</p>

              <p>He has hobbies and stuff but you don't want to read about
              that here.</p>

              <p>You can contact him by sending mail to <a href=
              "mailto:darin@bentspoon.com" class=
