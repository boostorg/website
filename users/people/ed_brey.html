              <p><img src="ed_brey.jpg" alt="-" class="portrait" /> Ed Brey
              lives in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, a village outside of
              Milwaukee. In the summertime, he likes to play tennis with his
              wife, and in the winter, if there is enough snow, he likes to
              go tobogganing or ice-skating. If it is not nice enough outside
              for either of those, he plays on the piano.</p>

              <p>Ed works at <a href="http://www.eaton.com" class=
              "external">Eaton Corporation</a> in Milwaukee. He started
              working there as part of <a href="http://www.mu.edu" class=
              "external">Marquette University</a>'s engineering co-op
              program. Upon graduation in 1995 from Marquette with a BS in
              electrical and computer engineering, he was hired on full-time,
              where he initially worked on firmware for industrial controls.
              More recently, he has been working on a PC-based configuration
              tool for industrial networks. Ed received his MS in computer
              engineering in 2001 from <a href="http://www.ntu.edu" class=
              "external">NTU</a>.</p>

              <p>Ed has held programming as a pastime since his grade school
              days, when he wrote a babysitting invoicing program. Soon
              after, he wrote a game inspired by the TV game show
              &ldquo;Press Your Luck&rdquo;. Ever since, programming
              languages and concepts, along with finding ways to improve the
              art and science of coding software, have always peeked his
              interest.</p>

              <p>Lastly, Ed has managed to retain his perspective. As fun as
              computers and programming are, Ed's true loves in life are the
              Lord Jesus whom he serves and his dear wife Beth.</p>
