              When Howard Hinnant is not monkeying around, he is a software
              engineer for Apple and represents Apple on the C++ Standards
              committee as Library Working Group Chairman.&nbsp; Howard has
              is also one of the co-authors / co-inventors of the rvalue
              reference work for C++09 making move semantics and perfect
              forwarding practical in C++.&nbsp; In the past Howard was the
              principal author of the CodeWarrior C++ library.</p>

              <p>Howard is married with four children, four dogs (he really
              isn't that fond of dogs), a rabbit, several exotic lizards with
              the usual accompaniment of insects (which the lizards are
              supposed to eat but find more entertaining to turn loose in the
              house), um... let's see ... fish, wild mice (they eventually
              kidnapped all the domesticated rodents), several dozen chickens
              (no I'm not kidding)...&nbsp; The neighbors are trying to turn
              my property into a federally protected wildlife preserve.&nbsp;
              They've got a fighting chance ... the kids alone would
              qualify.</p>

              <p>When not sitting in front of his computer, Howard enjoys
              snow skiing and ... more, snow skiing.</p>
