              Kevlin Henney (<a href="mailto:kevlin@curbralan.com" class=
              "external">mailto:kevlin@curbralan.com</a>, <a href=
              "http://www.curbralan.com" class=
              "external">http://www.curbralan.com</a>) is an independent
              consultant and trainer based in the UK. He has developed and
              delivered training course material and consultancy on many
              aspects of OO development, which he has practiced across a
              number of domains for longer than he cares (or can) remember.
              His professional interests include patterns, OO and
              component-based design, architecture, distributed object
              systems, and languages, including C++, C#, Java, and Ruby. He
              is also a member of the BSI C++ standards committee.</p>

              <p>Now that writing code is no longer the core responsibility
              of his job, his non-professional interests seem to include the
              hacking associated with the aforementioned professional
              interests. However, never being one to keep something to
              himself (like C++'s relationship with C, this is regarded as
              both a strength and a weakness), he shares/inflicts (delete as
              necessary) his professional and non-professional development
              experiences with/on (ditto) others through writing articles and
              presenting tutorials, workshops and papers at conferences.</p>

              <p>He is married, and not just to his work. He and Carolyn have
              one child, Stefan. The little spare time that remains to him is
              taken up with music, reading, pub appreciation, etc. Although
              with a newborn, there is more reading and less pub appreciation
              (pubs are still appreciated, but more in memory than in
              interaction). Finally, although he enjoys writing, Kevlin is
              not really one for writing in the third person.</p>
