              "portrait" /> Ralf is a crystallographer. He has a degree in
              Mineralogy (<a href=
              "http://www.mineralogie.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/eng/index.html"
              class="external">Bochum, Germany</a>), and a Ph.D. in
              Crystallography (<a href=
              "http://www.crystal.mat.ethz.ch/Intro/lfkcry" class=
              "external">ETH Zurich</a> , Switzerland). Real Mineralogists
              and Crystallographers run experiments with x-rays and hardware
              that is not normally associated with C++ and Boost. However,
              when Ralf kept breaking the expensive experimental equipment
              too often, he decided that he would cause less damage as a
              computational crystallographer.</p>

              <p>Being a scientist, Ralf spent most of his life programming
              in Fortran, the great grand-father of all good programming
              languages (if you know Backus-Naur you know the name of the
              <a href=
              "http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Backus.html"
              class="external">inventor of Fortran</a>). Ralf is a co-author
              of the <a href="http://cns.csb.yale.edu/" class=
              "external">CNS</a> Fortran program that is very popular in
              structural biology. When he learned that a real programmer can
              write Fortran in any language, Ralf knew that it was time for
              him to learn C++. Of course, absorbing four decades of progress
              in the field of computer science all at once crashed his brain.
              To be able to deal with the challenge, he spawned two child
              processes and named them Lisa and Anna. To see Lisa, click on
              the picture and turn your monitor by 180 degrees around the
              view axis. (Other pictures of <a href=
              "http://cci.lbl.gov/~rwgk/Lisa-Roza-Illes/" class=
              "external">Lisa</a> and <a href=
              "http://cci.lbl.gov/~rwgk/Anna-Rhona-Illes/" class=
              "external">Anna</a> do not require gymnastics with the
              monitor.)</p>

              <p>Right now, Ralf is working for the <a href=
              "http://cci.lbl.gov/" class="external">Computational
              Crystallography Initiative</a> at the <a href=
              "http://www.lbl.gov/" class="external">Lawrence Berkeley
              National Laboratory</a> in California. The goal of this
              initiative is to write a software system for high-throughput
              protein crystal structure determination, also known as <a href=
              "http://www.nigms.nih.gov/news/announcements/psi.html" class=
              "external">Structural Genomics</a>. Surprisingly, the gestation
              period for such a system turns out to be much longer than it
              was for Lisa and Anna. However, pre-natal diagnosis already
              revealed that Python and C++ are the parents-to-be. For an
              ultra-sound image of the new system at its early developmental
              stage <a href="http://cctbx.sourceforge.net/" class=
