              <p>Boost is used in a variety of Open Source Projects, both
              applications and libraries. Indeed many Open Source libraries
              developed around Boost have in the past been judged of high
              enough quality to be absorbed into the main Boost source tree,
              a process that will no doubt continue into the future. Others
              are in highly specialized niche markets, ranging from
              probability theory to astronomy, via mass spectroscopy:
              whatever your field of interest you'll find something of value
              in Boost.</p>

              <h2>Algocoders</h2>

              <p> <a class="external" href="http://www.algocoders.com">Algocoders</a>
              has been using boost since last 6+ years with a mission to help people
              build a better software eco-system by standing on the shoulder of giants.
              </p>
              
              <p> 
                If it wasn't for Boost, then it could have been really difficult for us
                to build our framework based on sound mathematical foundation of computer science
                using modern C++.

                It is the pioneering efforts at Boost towards
                "Using and Extending C++11, Boost and Beyond"
                which has motivated us to devote ourself in developing bullet-size capsules
                in the form of tiny booklets with industrial-set framework to lift the thin veil
                with initial focus on practical usage of C++11
                vis-a-vis mathematical foundation behind it.
               </p>

               <p>
                 Enthused by boost, we are working tirelessly towards publishing a series of
                 <a class="external" href="http://www.algocoders.com/article/books">books (or booklets)</a>
                 which will bridge the gap between esoteric and street-side ones.
                 Initial focus will be on C++11, Boost, Loki, STL, Algorithms, Data Structures,
                  Multi-threading, Design Patterns, gcc, Clang, valgrind.
               </p>

               <p>
                 First book in this series is Foundation of Algorithms in C++11, Volume 1:
                 Using and Extending C++11, Boost and Beyond (published December 2012)

               <p>
                 We use almost all the libraries in Boost including trunk and branches,
                 especially Spirit, Phoenix, Proto, MPL, Fusion.

              open-source, cross-platform XML Data Binding implementation for
              C++. Provided with an XML instance specification (XML Schema),
              it generates C++ classes that represent the given vocabulary as
              well as parsing and serialization code. You can then access the
              data stored in XML using types and functions that semantically
              correspond to your application domain rather than dealing with
              elements, attributes, and text in a direct representation of
              XML such as DOM or SAX.</p>
