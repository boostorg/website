              <p>Boost is used in a variety of Open Source Projects, both
              applications and libraries. Indeed many Open Source libraries
              developed around Boost have in the past been judged of high
              enough quality to be absorbed into the main Boost source tree,
              a process that will no doubt continue into the future. Others
              are in highly specialized niche markets, ranging from
              probability theory to astronomy, via mass spectroscopy:
              whatever your field of interest you'll find something of value
              in Boost.</p>

              open-source, cross-platform XML Data Binding implementation for
              C++. Provided with an XML instance specification (XML Schema),
              it generates C++ classes that represent the given vocabulary as
              well as parsing and serialization code. You can then access the
              data stored in XML using types and functions that semantically
              correspond to your application domain rather than dealing with
              elements, attributes, and text in a direct representation of
              XML such as DOM or SAX.</p>
